This category is triggered by language infoboxes which do not contain any language codes, such as [ISO 639-3](../Page/ISO_639-3.md "wikilink"), LingList, Guthrie, etc. (ISO 639-2 does not count, as it is not language-specific in such cases.)

Ideally, this category should be empty, apart from unclassified varieties such as [Danzhou dialect](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danzhou_dialect "wikilink"), which (as of 2012) are not clearly a dialect of an ISO language, but not clearly a distinct language either.

For languages which are simply not covered by ISO, enter `iso3=none`, and the article will appear in a dedicated category.

For dialects of languages which are covered by ISO, add the parameter `isoexception=dialect`. This is how dialects should normally be treated, as ISO codes are not generally dialect-specific and therefore should not be used in such cases; `iso3=none` is similarly inappropriate for dialects subsumed under the ISO code of their parent language. *Linguist List, Linguasphere,* Guthrie and AIATSIS may, however, provide dedicated codes that are appropriate for dialect articles; if one of these is added, the article will appear in a separate category.

If `isoexception` is set to `talkpage`, the article won't be listed in any category at all. This is used so that archived talk pages with discussions of the info box won't pollute the category.

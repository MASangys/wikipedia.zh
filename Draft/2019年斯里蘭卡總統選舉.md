### Poll Prediction

Both main candidates have had their own surveys carried out with the results claiming victory for each of them.\[45\] Earlier circulated polls prediction which was claimed done by National Intelligence Service was proved false and manipulated. \[46\]

## Nominations

<section end="interested" />

### Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna

After the massive victory they have got in Local Election, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna is looking to run for the presidential election. ,  and  being mentioned as credible prospects.\[47\]\[48\] Calls for  to run have been made though he is ineligible due to his possession of foreign citizenship.\[49\]  also holds foreign citizenship and is therefore ineligible.\[50\] On 12 January he announced he was ready to run in the elections if he had the support for it.\[51\]\[52\] Though his announcement stunned senior SLPP leaders who did not know beforehand.

has also signalled his potential candidacy saying that he would "willingly consider it if the party nominates him as the next Presidential Candidate", soon after the announcement of his brother. Chamal Rajapaksa has not decided whether to contest from the SLFP or the SLPP but prefers a candidate that has the support of both. Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the leading figure of the war victory of Sri Lanka and development process of Colombo metro region and northern province.\[53\]\[54\]\[55\]

In March Chamal denied that neither him nor Basil would contest but avoided commenting about Gotabhaya while the SLPP announced that they favour Gotabhaya unless someone better is found.\[56\]

Gotabhaya already had a well organized campaign promoting him and according to  the Rajapaksa family has chosen to support Gotabhaya as the candidate and is renouncing his US citizenship.\[57\]

Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, on 11th of 6 days after the [2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings](../Page/2019年斯里蘭卡連環爆炸.md "wikilink"), announced his candidacy for president.\[58\] On 11 August [Mahinda Rajapaksa](../Page/马欣达·拉贾帕克萨.md "wikilink") and his Sri Lanka Podujana Party officially announces his brother Gotabhaya to be its presidential candidate, while Mahinda runs as his Prime Ministerial candidate.\[59\]\[60\]\[61\]

### United National Party (UNP)

United National Party didn't field a presidential candidate in both 2010 and 2015 elections and supported a common candidate. Even though they won the 2015 election and elected [Maithripala Sirisena](../Page/邁特里帕拉·西里塞納.md "wikilink") from their support, relations between the president and the UNP was shaky from the beginning. Power struggle between the president and UNP prime minister [Ranil Wickremesinghe](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranil_Wickremesinghe "wikilink") led to the [2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis](../Page/2018年斯里蘭卡憲法危機.md "wikilink"). In the aftermath of the events, most of the UNP members publicly expressed their regret supporting a common candidate in 2015 and promised to field their own presidential candidate in 2019 elections.

Party leader [Ranil Wickremesinghe](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranil_Wickremesinghe "wikilink") was the obvious choice for the candidacy and he reportedly expressed his intentions to run for the presidency in a meeting with other senior members.\[62\] Meanwhile, several rebel MPs including , , , ,  wanted deputy leader  as the candidate and organized a rally in badulla where Sajith himself openly expressed his intentions to be the UNP candidate\[63\]

With the growing support for the deputy leader  and party leader [Ranil Wickremesinghe](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranil_Wickremesinghe "wikilink") refusing to make a move, Speaker of the parliament  released a statement signalling his intention to run for presidency to end the confusion and avoid a rift within the party\[64\] However Sajith faction showed that they has the popular support among party members and followers by organizing successful rallies in [Matara](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/馬塔拉_\(斯里蘭卡\) "wikilink")\[65\] \[66\] and .\[67\]

On 26 September 2019, Working committee of United National Party unanimously decided  as the UNP presidential candidate. Announcing the official statement, general Secretary of the UNP  told that [Ranil Wickremesinghe](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranil_Wickremesinghe "wikilink") will continue to function as the Prime Minister and the Leader of the UNP.

### Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)

President and leader of the SLFP [Maithripala Sirisena](../Page/邁特里帕拉·西里塞納.md "wikilink") is eligible to run for a second term. Although he has previously stated, after being sworn in in 2015, that he would only serve the single term, he has since expressed his desire to stay on for a second term.\[68\]\[69\] However, with many party seniors choose to support newly formed  led by former SLFP leader [Mahinda Rajapaksa](../Page/马欣达·拉贾帕克萨.md "wikilink"), SLFP got weakened and suffered a heavy loss in , thus losing the credibility it had as the main opposition force to the UNP.

SLFP pledge to support SLPP candidate  on 9 October.\[70\]

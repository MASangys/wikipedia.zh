**文明**是维基百科的[基本礼仪并且是](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Etiquette "wikilink")[五大支柱之一](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars "wikilink")。文明守则描述了对用户的礼仪要求以及处理问题的解决方案。简而言之，编者应当互相尊重体谅。在专注于提升百科质量的同时，维护一个令人愉快的编辑环境。为此，在即便是激烈的讨论中，也因表现地有礼貌，冷静，有条理。

维基百科的文明守则适用与编者在维基百科上的交流，包括在[用户页和条目的交流](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/用户页 "wikilink")，在[编注中](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/编注 "wikilink")，或是与其他[维基人](../Page/维基人.md "wikilink")或者涉及到其他维基人的交流中。

## 合作与文明

[Jimmy_Carter_greets_residents_of_South_Bronx,_New_York_-_NARA_-_176402.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jimmy_Carter_greets_residents_of_South_Bronx,_New_York_-_NARA_-_176402.jpg "fig:Jimmy_Carter_greets_residents_of_South_Bronx,_New_York_-_NARA_-_176402.jpg") 在合作中，观点的不同是不可避免的。当在讨论这些不同时，部分编者可能显得刻薄，但只是希望坦诚。其他编者在自己的观点受到挑战是，可能会觉得激动。无法面对面交流的情况下，讨论页和编注的书面文字不能完全反应对话的情绪，有时会导致编者的评论被误读。一个不文明的评论可以轻松地将一次有趣地讨论变成个人攻击战，而不再专注于问题本身。这样的交互不仅浪费我们的精力，也有损积极有效的工作环境。请通过文明的交流解决观点的不一样；不同意但不要不近人情。对其他编者的讨论应该局限于文明地讨论他们的操作。

我们期待编者一定程度上的[合作](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Etiquette "wikilink")，不去进行[人身攻击](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPA "wikilink")，在[指引的范围内行事](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:方针与指引 "wikilink")，回答有[诚意的问题](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith "wikilink")。把其他编辑者当做你在一个很重要的项目中一起工作的受人尊重的同事。对积极建设的新用户要特别友好和有耐心[new users](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers "wikilink")，并礼貌地阻止不作建设性工作的新人。

### 避免不文明

不文明 -或者是其体现 –通常在激烈地讨论中出现。

  - *解释一下Explain yourself*. Insufficient [explanations](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EP#Be_helpful:_explain "wikilink") for edits can be perceived as uncivil. Use good edit summaries, and use the talk page if the edit summary does not provide enough space or if a more substantive debate is likely to be needed.
  - *小心使用警告模板Be careful with user warning templates*. Be careful about issuing templated messages to editors you're currently involved in a dispute with, and exercise caution when using templated messages for newcomers (see [Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers "wikilink")). Consider using a personal message instead of, or in addition to, the templated message.
  - *Try not to get too intense*. Passion can be misread as aggression, so take great care to avoid the appearance of being heavy-handed or bossy. Nobody likes to be *bossed about* by an editor who appears to believe that they are "superior"; nobody likes a bully.
  - *避免心情不好的时候编辑Avoid editing while you're in a bad mood.* It *does* spill over. (See [Editing under the influence](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EUI "wikilink") and [No angry mastodons](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MASTODON "wikilink"))
  - *不要人肉别人Take a Real-Life check*. Disengage by *two* steps to assess what you're about to say (or have just said). Asking yourself "How would I feel if someone said that to me?" is often not enough, many people can just brush things off. To get a better perspective, ask yourself: "How would I feel if someone said that to someone I love who *cannot* just 'brush it off'?" If you would find that unacceptable, then *do not say it*. And, if you have already said it, strike it and apologise.
  - *专业态度Be professional*. Just because we are online and unpaid does not mean we can behave badly to each other. People working together in a newspaper office are not supposed to get into punch-ups in the newsroom because they disagree about how something is worded or whose turn it is to make the coffee. Nor are volunteers working at the animal rescue centre allowed to start screaming at each other over who left ferrets in the filing cabinet or the corn snake in the cutlery drawer. In fact, there's pretty much nowhere where people working together to do something good are allowed to get into fist-fights, shouting matches, hair-pulling or name-calling; the same principle applies here.
  - *不要骂人Avoid name-calling*. Someone may very well be an idiot, but telling them so is neither going to increase their intelligence nor improve your ability to communicate with them.
  - *不要装大人Avoid condescension*. No matter how frustrated you are, do **not** tell people to "grow up" or include any language along the lines of "if this were kindergarten" in your messages.
  - *不要嘲讽别人的发言Avoid appearing to ridicule another editor's comment*. Even if you see the comment as ridiculous, he or she very probably doesn't, and expressing ridicule is likely only to offend and antagonise, rather than helping.
  - *小心编辑编注Be careful with edit summaries*. They are relatively short comments and thus potentially subject to misinterpretation or oversimplification. They cannot be changed after pressing "Save", and are often written in haste, particularly in stressful situations. Remember to [explain your edit](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EP#Be_helpful:_explain "wikilink"), especially when things are getting heated; to avoid personal comments about any editors you have disputes with; and to use the talk page to further explain your view of the situation.

### Edit summary dos and don'ts

Review your edit summaries before saving your edits. Remember you cannot go back and change them.

  - Do

<!-- end list -->

  - Be clear about what you did, so that other editors can assess it quickly.
  - Use neutral language.
  - Be calm.

<!-- end list -->

  - Don't

<!-- end list -->

  - Make snide comments.
  - Make [personal remarks](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:No_personal_attacks "wikilink") about editors.
  - Be aggressive.

## Incivility

|                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Civility is to human nature what warmth is to wax."                                      |
| —[Arthur Schopenhauer](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer "wikilink")\[1\] |

Incivility consists of personal attacks, [rudeness](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don't_be_rude "wikilink") and disrespectful comments. Especially when done in an aggressive manner, these often alienate editors and disrupt the project through unproductive stressors and conflict. While a few minor incidents of incivility that no one complains about are not necessarily a concern, a continuing pattern of incivility is unacceptable. In cases of repeated [harassment](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Harassment "wikilink") or egregious personal attacks, then the offender may be [blocked](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Blocking_policy "wikilink"). Even a single act of severe incivility could result in a block, such as a single episode of extreme [verbal abuse](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/verbal_abuse "wikilink") or [profanity](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/profanity "wikilink") directed at another contributor, or a threat against another person.

In general, *be understanding and non-retaliatory in dealing with incivility*. If others are uncivil, do not respond in kind. Consider ignoring isolated examples of incivility, and simply moving forward with the content issue. If necessary, point out gently that you think the comment might be considered uncivil and make it clear that you want to move on and focus on the content issue. Bear in mind that the editor may not have thought he or she was being uncivil; Wikipedia is edited by people from many different backgrounds, and standards vary. Take things to dispute resolution (see [below](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Dispute_resolution "wikilink")) only if there is an ongoing problem that you cannot resolve.

This policy is not a weapon to use against other contributors. To insist that an editor be [sanctioned](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Sanctions_\(essay\) "wikilink") for an isolated, minor incident, to repeatedly bring up past incivility after an individual has changed their approach, or to treat constructive criticism as an attack, are in themselves potentially disruptive, and may result in warnings or even blocks if repeated.

### No personal attacks or harassment

Editors are expected to avoid [personal attacks](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:personal "wikilink") and [harassment](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:harassment "wikilink") of other Wikipedians. This applies equally to all Wikipedians: it is as unacceptable to attack a user who has a history of foolish or boorish behaviour, or even one who has been subject to disciplinary action by the Arbitration Committee, as it is to attack any other user. Wikipedia encourages a positive online community: people make mistakes, but they are encouraged to learn from them and change their ways. Personal attacks and harassment are contrary to this spirit, damaging to the work of building an encyclopedia, and may result in [blocks](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLOCK "wikilink").

## Identifying incivility

It is sometimes difficult to make a hard-and-fast judgement of what is uncivil and what is not. Editors should take into account factors such as (i) the intensity and context of the language/behaviour; (ii) whether the behaviour has occurred on a single occasion, or is occasional or regular; (iii) whether a request has already been made to stop the behaviour, and whether that request is recent; (iv) whether the behaviour has been provoked; and (v) the extent to which the behaviour of others need to be treated at the same time.

The following behaviours can contribute to an uncivil environment:

**1. Direct rudeness**

  - (a) rudeness, insults, name-calling, gross [profanity](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/profanity "wikilink") or indecent suggestions
  - (b) [personal attacks](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks "wikilink"), including racial, ethnic, sexual, disability-related, gender-related and religious slurs, and derogatory references to groups such as social classes or nationalities
  - (c) ill-considered accusations of impropriety
  - (d) belittling a fellow editor, including the use of judgemental edit summaries or talk-page posts (e.g. "that is the stupidest thing I have ever seen", "snipped crap")

**2. Other uncivil behaviours**

  - (a) [taunting](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary:taunt "wikilink") or [baiting](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don't_take_the_bait "wikilink"): deliberately pushing others to the point of breaching civility even if not seeming to commit such a breach themselves. All editors are responsible for their own actions in cases of baiting; a user who is baited is not excused by that if they attack in response, and a user who baits is not excused from their actions by the fact that the bait may be taken.
  - (b) [harassment](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Harassment "wikilink"), including [Wikihounding](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Hounding#Wikihounding "wikilink"), bullying, personal or legal threats, posting of personal information, repeated email or user space postings
  - (c) [sexual harassment](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexual_harassment "wikilink")
  - (d) lying
  - (e) quoting another editor [out of context](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_quoting_out_of_context "wikilink") to give the impression they hold views they do not hold, or to malign them

In addition, lack of care when applying other policies can lead to conflict and stress. For instance, referring to a user's good-faith edits as [vandalism](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism "wikilink") may lead to their feeling unfairly attacked. Use your best judgement, and be ready to apologize if you turn out to be wrong.

### Assume good faith

The [assume good faith](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith "wikilink") (AGF) guideline states that unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, editors should assume that others are trying to help, not hurt the project.

The guideline does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of obvious evidence of intentional wrongdoing. However, do not assume there is more misconduct than evidence supports. Given equally plausible interpretations of the evidence, choose the most positive one.

## Dealing with incivility

1.  First of all, consider whether you and the other editor may simply have misunderstood each other. Clarify, and ask for clarification.
2.  Consider the possibility that something you said or did wrongly provoked a defensive, irritated or fed-up response. Be prepared to apologise for anything which you could / should have done better. ([If an awful lot of people seem to be getting frustrated with you, the problem may be with you](https://en.wikipedia.org/?diff=750128981).)
3.  Even if you're offended, be as *calm and reasonable* as possible in your response. Until there is clear evidence to the contrary, assume that the offense was unintended.
4.  Explain, clearly but kindly, exactly what you felt was uncivil. Sometimes it helps to let the other editor know how their edit made *you* feel. Editors are not mind-readers. (*"That made me feel..."* is much less likely to incite more anger or resentment than *"Your post was..."*)
5.  Ask them to strike out an uncivil comment, or re-word it calmly and neutrally, if they have not already done so by this point.
6.  No matter how much you're being provoked, resist the temptation to snap back. It never works; it just makes things worse. Strive to become [the editor who can't be baited](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ThatPeskyCommoner/Essay_on_civility "wikilink").
7.  If none of this is working, and the other person is not damaging the project or being uncivil or unkind to other editors, either walk away or request [dispute resolution](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:DRN "wikilink") from uninvolved editors.
8.  In "emergency" situations, where the other editor needs to be stopped in their tracks to avoid causing serious disruption or needs a fast and strong wake-up call, file a report at [the administrator "Incidents" noticeboard](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AN/I "wikilink"). Bear in mind the risk of being hoist by your own [petard](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:PETARD "wikilink") if you yourself are guilty of policy violations. Please also read the [ANI Advice](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ANI_Advice "wikilink") first.

### Dispute resolution

In a case of ongoing incivility, first decide if anything needs to be done. Confronting someone over a minor incident – particularly if it turns out that you misinterpreted what they meant – may produce more stress and drama than the incident itself. Consider your own behaviour, and, if you find you have been uncivil, [apologize](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Apology "wikilink") to him or her instead.

In escalating order of seriousness, here are the venues you may use for dispute resolution if the relevant page's talk page is insufficient:

  - *[User talk page](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page "wikilink")*. If some action is necessary, first consider discussing it on that user's talk page. Be careful not to escalate the situation, and politely explain your objection. You may also wish to include a [diff](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Diff "wikilink") of the specific uncivil statement. If you are in active dispute with the user, consider offering an [olive branch](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/olive_branch "wikilink") to them instead.
  - *[Third opinion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Third_opinion "wikilink")*. This forum can be used to request outside input from an uninvolved user regarding the problem. Like many [Wikipedia:Dispute resolution](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution "wikilink") processes, it is limited to encyclopedia content disputes.
  - *[Administrators' noticeboard](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents "wikilink") (AN/I)*. The Administrators' noticeboard is intended to report and discuss severe incidents of misconduct that require intervention by administrators and experienced editors.
  - The last step – only when other avenues have been tried and failed – is the *[Arbitration Committee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee "wikilink")*, who will scrutinise all sides involved in the dispute and create binding resolutions.

**Threats of violence** (including death threats and suicide threats) should be reported **immediately** by e-mail to the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WMF "wikilink") at ; see [WP:VIOLENCE](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:VIOLENCE "wikilink") for more on this. For [legal threats](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_legal_threats "wikilink"), bigoted attacks or other hateful speech, and other cases where immediate action is required, use the [Administrator's Noticeboard Incidents page](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents "wikilink") to contact the site's admins.

### Removing uncivil comments

Where the uncivil comment is yours, any of these options will help to reduce the impact:

  - Where someone is unintentionally offended at your comment, calmly explain what you meant.
  - Strike it out (using <s><s>HTML strikeout tags</s></s>), to show, publicly, that you withdraw the comment.
  - Quietly remove it, or rewrite the comment to be more civil – Usually only a good idea if you think better of it before anyone objected to it. If someone has already reacted, you should acknowledge the change in a quick comment after the changed text, for instance, *Comment removed by author*.
  - Simply apologize. This option *never* hurts, and can be combined well with any of the others. Even if you feel the thrust of your words is true, or that they are misunderstanding what you meant, you can still apologize.

In the event of rudeness or incivility on the part of another editor, it may be appropriate to discuss the offending words with that editor, and to request that editor to change that specific wording. Some care is necessary, however, so as not to further inflame the situation. It is not normally appropriate to edit or remove another editor's comment. Exceptions include to remove obvious [trolling](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:TROLL "wikilink") or [vandalism](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism "wikilink"), or if the comment is on your own user talk page. Derogatory comments about another contributor may be removed by any editor.

A special case is [outing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Outing "wikilink"), that is, revealing [personally identifiable information](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/personally_identifiable_information "wikilink") about another editor that they have not revealed themselves and probably do not want known, such as their name, phone number or address. These should be immediately reverted, then an [oversighter](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Oversight "wikilink") should be contacted to remove the information from the edit history, so that it cannot be found by anyone else later. This applies *whether or not the information is correct*, as to confirm the information is incorrect by treating it any differently gives the outer useful information. [Wikipedia:Outing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Outing "wikilink") has full information.

#### Different places, different atmospheres

Article talk pages should be, on the whole, considered to be professional workspaces. They're places to talk about how to improve the article, and to discuss the article (though it's OK for conversations to wander into related areas, or go more into depth than the article does, as that helps with research and gives ideas on improvement). But an editor's talk page is more like their kitchen; it's more informal, and (within reason) it's up to them what happens in there. Clearly, just like in a real kitchen, it's no more acceptable to stick a knife in someone than it is in the office. Personal attacks are not acceptable anywhere, but expect users' own talk pages to have a much more informal atmosphere than article talk pages.

### Apologising: It's OK to say sorry

Disputes, and even misunderstandings, can lead to situations in which one party feels injured by the other. There's no loss of face in apologising. We all make mistakes, we all say the odd hurtful thing, we all have bad days and bad moments. If you have a sneaky feeling you owe someone an [apology](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/meta:apology "wikilink"), offer the apology. Apologising does not hurt you.

Remember, though, that you cannot *demand* an apology from anyone else. It will only get their back up and make it either less likely to happen, or to be totally insincere if you do get an apology. Never be too proud to make the first move when it comes to saying sorry. That kind of "pride" is destructive. An apology provides the opportunity for a fresh start, and can clear the air when one person's perceived incivility has offended another.

### Blocking for incivility

Blocking for incivility is possible when incivility causes serious [disruption](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:DE "wikilink"). However, the civility policy is *not* intended to be used as a weapon and blocking should not be the first option in most cases.

1.  Be sure to take into account all the relevant history. Avoid snap judgments without acquainting yourself with the background to any situation.
2.  Think very hard of the possible merits of *all* other avenues of approach before you take action. Sanctions for civility violations should only happen when *nothing else would do*. Poorly considered civility blocks have at times worsened disputes and increased disruption. Remember that sanctions may be more applicable under another heading ([disruption](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:DISRUPT "wikilink"), [personal attack](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPA "wikilink"), [tendentious editing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:TE "wikilink"), or [harassment](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:HARASS "wikilink"))
3.  Civility blocks should be for obvious and uncontentious reasons, because an editor has stepped over the line in a manner nearly all editors can see. In cases where you have reason to suspect this would not be the case – cases where there is reason to believe that taking admin action against someone who was uncivil would *not* be an uncontentious (or nearly so) prospect – it is expected that discussion will be opened on the matter, via [WP:ANI](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ANI "wikilink"), before any admin action is taken. Benefits derived from long or controversial civility blocks should be weighed against the potential for disruption caused by block reviews, and unblock requests.\[2\]
4.  Users should be clearly warned, in most circumstances, before being blocked for incivility, and should be allowed sufficient time to retract, refactor or explain uncivil comments. Even experienced contributors should not be blocked without warning. Exceptions to this may include users who make egregious violations or threats, or who have received multiple warnings.

This is not to say that blocking for incivility should not or cannot happen, but immediate blocking is generally reserved for cases of **major** incivility, where incivility rises to the level of clear disruption, personal attacks, harassment or [outing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:OUTING "wikilink"). As with other blocks, civility blocks should be preventative and [not punitive](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLOCK#NOTPUNITIVE "wikilink").\[3\]

3.  "the law and its fulfillment, namely punishment, are directed essentially to the *future*, not to the *past*. This distinguishes *punishment* from *revenge*, for revenge is motivated by what has happened, and hence by the past as such.

Such a thing is wickedness and cruelty, and cannot be ethically justified." —[Arthur Schopenhauer](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer "wikilink") *[The World as Will and Representation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation "wikilink")*, Vol. I, § 62.

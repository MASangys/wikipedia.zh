维基百科**方针指引**是由社群自发编撰以记录最佳实践、理清原则、解决争议，或者以其他方式达成我们创办免费可靠的百科全书的目的。编辑前无需阅读任何方针指引。[五大支柱是对我们原则的最佳概述](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/五大支柱 "wikilink")。Wikipedia
**policies and guidelines** are developed by the community to describe
best practices, clarify principles, resolve conflicts, and otherwise
further our goal of creating a free, reliable encyclopedia. There is no
need to read any policy or guideline pages to start editing. The [five
pillars](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars "wikilink")
is a popular summary of the most pertinent principles.

维基百科通常没有硬性规定，方针指引页记录其原则和公认的最佳实践。方针是所有用户通常需要遵循的，而指引通常是在特定情境中以达成这些标准的最佳实践。方针与指引永远应该在理性和常识的基础上应用。

Although Wikipedia generally [does not employ hard-and-fast
rules](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_bureaucracy "wikilink"),
Wikipedia's policy and guideline pages describe its principles and
agreed-upon best practices. Policies are standards that all users should
normally follow, and guidelines are generally meant to be best practices
for following those standards in specific contexts. Policies and
guidelines should always be applied using reason and [common
sense](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_"Ignore_all_rules"_means#Use_common_sense "wikilink").

此方针说明了社群对方针指引及相关页面的组织、生命周期、维护、遵循的期待。

This policy page specifies the community standards related to the
organization, life cycle, maintenance of, and adherence to policies,
guidelines, and related pages.

## 引申

维基百科由非盈利组织维基媒体基金会运营，保留相关法律权利——参见维基媒体基金会政策以获知详情。参见吉米·威尔士的角色。尽管如此，通常维基百科是一个社群自治的项目。其方针和指引意在反应社群共识。Wikipedia
is operated by the not-for-profit [Wikimedia
Foundation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation "wikilink"),
which reserves certain legal rights—see [the Wikimedia Foundation's
Policies
page](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundation:Policies "wikilink") for
a list of its policies. See also [Role of Jimmy
Wales](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Role_of_Jimmy_Wales "wikilink").
Nevertheless, normally Wikipedia is a self-governing project run by its
community. Its policies and guidelines are intended to reflect the
[consensus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Consensus "wikilink") of
the community.

## 角色

**方针** have wide acceptance among editors and describe standards that
all users should
[normally](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules "wikilink")
follow. All policy pages are in [Wikipedia:List of policies and
guidelines](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_policies_and_guidelines "wikilink")
and [:Category:Wikipedia
policies](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_policies "wikilink").
For summaries of key policies, see also [List of
policies](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_policies "wikilink").

**指引** are sets of best practices that are supported by consensus.
Editors should attempt to follow guidelines, though they are best
treated with common sense, and occasional exceptions may apply.
Guideline pages can be found in [Wikipedia:List of policies and
guidelines](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_policies_and_guidelines "wikilink")
and [:Category:Wikipedia
guidelines](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_guidelines "wikilink").
For summaries of key guidelines, see also [List of
guidelines](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_guidelines "wikilink").

**Essays** are the opinion or advice of an editor or group of editors
for which widespread consensus has not been established. They do not
speak for the entire community and may be created and written without
approval. Essays that the author does not want others to edit, or that
are found to contradict widespread consensus, belong in the [user
namespace](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_pages "wikilink").

Other [administration
pages](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administration#Data_structure_and_development "wikilink")
in the [Wikipedia:
namespace](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Project_namespace "wikilink")
include:

  - **process pages**, which facilitate application of the policies and
    guidelines (e.g., [Wikipedia:Articles for
    deletion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion "wikilink")),
  - **[WikiProject](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject "wikilink")
    pages**, including [essays they have written to give advice to other
    editors](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_advice_pages "wikilink")
    about their areas of interest,
  - **[how-to](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_pages_‎ "wikilink")
    or help pages** (also found in the [Help
    namespace](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Help_namespace "wikilink")),
    which provide mainly technical information,
  - **[information
    pages](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Information_pages "wikilink")**,
    which generally provide factual information,
  - **[supplements](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Supplemental_pages "wikilink")**
    to guidelines and policies, which explain advice in greater detail,
  - **[community discussion
    pages](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_discussion "wikilink")**
    and
    **[noticeboards](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_noticeboards "wikilink")**
    for communication between editors, and
  - **historical pages**, which are outdated.\[1\]

These other pages are not policies or guidelines, although they may
contain valuable advice or information.

## 遵守

解释与应用方针指引时请[使用常识](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:忽略所有規則初學者指南 "wikilink")；部分情况下或有例外。相反地，对于违背规则精神或被责备，尽管技术上没有破坏规则。
when interpreting and applying policies and guidelines; there will be
[occasional
exceptions](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules "wikilink")
to these rules. Conversely, those who violate the spirit of a rule may
be reprimanded even if no rule has technically been broken.

一则方针指引是否是最佳实践的准确描述由社群通过[共识决定](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:共识 "wikilink")。

Whether a policy or guideline is an accurate description of best
practice is determined by the community through
[consensus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus "wikilink").

在讨论页和编注中，常用缩写指代方针指引。比如[WP:NOR](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOR "wikilink")，[WP:NPOV和](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV "wikilink")[WP:LIVE](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:LIVE "wikilink")。类似的缩写有时也可指代其他类型的项目页面。缩写本身不代表页面是方针或指引。更多的，记住快捷键不是方针；对方针指引页的标题字面意可能和具体内容的意义大不相同。

On discussion pages and in edit summaries, shortcuts are often used to
refer to policies and guidelines. For example,
[WP:NOR](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOR "wikilink"),
[WP:NPOV](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV "wikilink"), and
[WP:LIVE](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:LIVE "wikilink"). Similar
shortcuts are sometimes also used for other types of project page. A
shortcut does not necessarily imply that the page linked to has policy
or guideline status. Additionally, remember that [the shortcut is not
the
policy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map–territory_relation "wikilink");
the plain-English definition of the page's title or shortcut may be
importantly different from the linked page.

## 执行

维基百科上规则的执行与其他社交场合类似。如果编者违背了在方针指引中描述的社群标准，其他编者可以劝说此人遵守行为常规，逐步升级到更强制的措施，比如管理员或者行政员操作。在严重违反社群常态的情况下，他们可能更快采取强制措施。违反相应页面上列举的原则，特别是方针页上的，很少会被接受，但想要说服其他编辑是特殊情况也是可能的。

当一名用户的行为明确违反方针，且他们故意、长期地这么做，那么这名用户可能会被临时或者永久静止编辑。常规的争议解决机制应当优先适用。

Enforcement on Wikipedia is similar to other social interactions. If an
editor violates the community standards described in policies and
guidelines, other editors can persuade the person to adhere to
[acceptable norms of
conduct](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CONDUCT "wikilink"), over time
resorting to more forceful means, such as
[administrator](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators "wikilink")
and
[steward](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stewards "wikilink")
actions. In the case of gross violations of community norms, they are
likely to resort to more forceful means fairly rapidly. Going against
the principles set out on these pages, particularly policy pages, is
unlikely to prove acceptable, although it may be possible to convince
fellow editors that [an exception ought to be
made](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:IAR "wikilink"). This means that
individual editors (including *you*) enforce and apply policies and
guidelines.

In cases where it is clear that a user is acting against policy (or
against a guideline in a way that conflicts with policy), especially if
they are doing so intentionally and persistently, that user may be
temporarily or indefinitely
[blocked](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Blocking_policy "wikilink")
from editing by an administrator. In cases where the general [dispute
resolution](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution "wikilink")
procedure has been ineffective, the [Arbitration
Committee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee "wikilink")
has the power to deal with highly disruptive or sensitive situations.

## 内容

方针指引页面应该：

Policy and guideline pages should:

  - **清晰。**

<!-- end list -->

  - **Be clear**. Avoid esoteric or quasi-legal terms and dumbed-down
    language. Be plain, direct, unambiguous, and specific. Avoid
    platitudes and generalities. Do not be afraid to tell editors
    directly that they must or should do something.
  - **干练。**
  - **Be as concise as possible—but no more concise.** Verbosity is not
    a reliable defense against misinterpretation. Omit needless words.
    Direct, concise writing may be more clear than rambling examples.
    Footnotes and links to other pages may be used for further
    clarification.
  - **强调规则的精神。**
  - **Emphasize the spirit of the rule.** Expect editors to use common
    sense. If the spirit of the rule is clear, say no more.
  - **专注且无不冗长。**
  - **Maintain scope and avoid redundancy.** Clearly identify the
    purpose and scope early in the page, as many readers will just look
    at the beginning. Content should be within the scope of its policy.
    When the scope of one advice page overlaps with the scope of
    another, minimize redundancy. When one policy refers to another
    policy, it should do so briefly, clearly and explicitly.
  - **不要过度链接。**
  - **Avoid overlinking.** Links to policies, guidelines, essays, and
    articles should be used only when clarification or context is
    needed. Links to other advice pages may inadvertently or
    intentionally defer authority to them. Make it clear when links
    defer, and when they do not.
  - **不要互相矛盾。**
  - **Not contradict each other.** The community's view cannot
    simultaneously be "A" and "not A". When apparent discrepancies arise
    between pages, editors at all the affected pages should discuss how
    they can most accurately represent the community's current position,
    and correct all of the pages to reflect the community's view. This
    discussion should be on <u>one</u> talk page, with invitations to
    that page at the talk pages of the various affected pages; otherwise
    the corrections may still contradict each other.

## 不属于百科全书

维基百科有许多关于内容的方针指引。这些指引要求可供查证，中立，尊重生者等。

Wikipedia has many policies and guidelines about encyclopedic
[content](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content "wikilink").
These standards require verifiability, neutrality, respect for living
people, and more.

方针、指引和流程页本身不是百科全书本体。因此，通常不需要想条目一样遵守相应的内容标准或者格式指南。因此不必提供对维基百科管理页面的“可靠来源”，或者把维基百科原则流程以“中立”的形式叙述，或者引用外界权威以确定维基百科的编辑实践。反之，这些页面上的内容应该由“社群范围”的共识控制，风格应当注重清晰，直接且对其他编者有用。

The policies, guidelines, and process pages themselves are not part of
the encyclopedia proper. Consequently, they do not generally need to
conform to the same [content
standards](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies "wikilink")
or [style conventions](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MOS "wikilink")
as articles. It is therefore not necessary to provide [reliable
sources](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources "wikilink")
to
[verify](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "wikilink")
Wikipedia's administrative pages, or to phrase Wikipedia procedures or
principles in a
[neutral](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view "wikilink")
manner, or to [cite an outside
authority](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research "wikilink")
in determining Wikipedia's editorial practices. Instead, the content of
these pages is controlled by [community-wide
consensus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Consensus "wikilink"), and
the style should emphasize clarity, directness, and usefulness to other
editors.\[2\]

尽管如此，这些页面需要遵循维基百的法律和行为方针，以及其他适用于非内容页面的方针。比如，编者在任何地方都不应该侵犯版权，或者是打编辑站。

These pages do, however, need to comply with Wikipedia's legal and
behavioral policies, as well as policies applicable to non-content
pages. For example, editors may not violate copyrights anywhere on
Wikipedia, and edit warring is prohibited everywhere, not merely in
encyclopedia articles.

## 生命周期

许多方针指引都基于维基百科建立之时就有的基本原则延展而开。其他的则作为对常见问题及破坏性编辑的解决方案。方针指引页很少在没有先例的情况下被建立，而且总是需要强力的社群支持。方针指引可以通过新提案，升级已有的论述或者指引，以及拆分合并已有方针指引的方式形成。

Many of the most well-established policies and guidelines have developed
from principles which have been accepted as fundamental since
Wikipedia's inception. Others developed as solutions to common problems
and disruptive editing. Policy and guideline pages are seldom
established without precedent,\[3\] and always require strong community
support. Policies and guidelines may be established through new
proposals, promotion of existing essays or guidelines, and
reorganization of existing policies and guidelines through splitting and
merging.

论述和信息页可以以在页面上添加, , ,
或其他[类似模板的形式形成](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_messages/Wikipedia_namespace "wikilink")。

Essays and information pages may be established by writing them and
adding , , , or [a similar
template](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_messages/Wikipedia_namespace "wikilink")
to the page.

当前的方针指引提案可以在[:Category:维基百科提案中找到](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:维基百科提案 "wikilink")，失败的提案可以在[维基百科失败的提案中找到](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/维基百科失败的提案 "wikilink")。欢迎所有编者在这些提案上评论。

Current policy and guideline proposals can be found in
[:Category:Wikipedia
proposals](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_proposals "wikilink"),
and failed proposals can be found in [:Category:Wikipedia failed
proposals](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_failed_proposals "wikilink").
All editors are welcome to comment on these proposals.

### 提案

WP:POLL § Policy and guidelines|Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is
not\#Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy{{\!}}WP:NOTBUREAUCRACY}} Proposals
for new guidelines and policies require discussion and a [high level of
consensus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Local_consensus "wikilink")
from the entire community for promotion to guideline or policy. Adding
the  template to a page without the required consensus does not mean
that the page is policy, even if the page summarizes or copies policy.
Most commonly, a new policy or guideline documents existing practices,
rather than proposing a change to what experienced editors already
choose to do.

#### 提案的良好实践Good practice for proposals

The first step is to write the best initial proposal that you can.
Authors can request early-stage feedback at [Wikipedia's village pump
for idea
incubation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_\(idea_lab\) "wikilink")
and from any relevant WikiProjects. Amendments to a proposal can be
discussed on its talk page. It is crucial to improve a proposal in
response to feedback received from outside editors. Consensus is built
through a process of listening to and discussing the proposal with many
other editors.

Once you think that the initial proposal is well-written, and the issues
involved have been sufficiently discussed among early participants to
create a proposal that has a solid chance of success with the broader
community, start an RfC for your policy or guideline proposal in a new
section on the talk page, and include the  tag along with a brief,
time-stamped explanation of the proposal. After that, you can provide,
if you want, a detailed explanation of what the page does and why you
think it should be a policy or guideline. The  template should be placed
at the top of the proposed page; this tag will get the proposal properly
categorized.

The RfC should typically be announced at the
[policy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_\(policy\) "wikilink")
and/or
[proposals](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_\(proposals\) "wikilink")
village pumps, and you should notify other potentially interested
groups. If your proposal affects a specific content area, then related
WikiProjects can be found at the [WikiProject
directory](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Directory "wikilink").
If your proposal relates to an existing policy or guideline, then leave
a note on the talk page of the related policy or guideline. Try to
identify the subcategory of guideline or policy (see ). Proposals
involving contentious subjects or wide-ranging effects should normally
be listed on [Wikipedia:Centralized
discussion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Centralized_discussion "wikilink")
for the duration of the RfC. Rarely, a particularly important proposal
may be advertised via a [watchlist
notice](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Watchlist_notices "wikilink");
sitenotices (which are displayed to all readers, not just to active
editors) are not used for proposals. RfCs for policy and guideline
proposals are normally left open for at least one week, and sometimes as
long as a couple of months.

To avoid later complaints about insufficient notice, it may be helpful
to provide a complete list of the groups or pages that you used to
advertise the proposal on the talk page. Be careful to not
[canvass](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CANVASSING "wikilink") with
non-neutral wording.

Editors should respond to proposals in a way that helps identify and
build consensus. Explain your thoughts, ask questions, and raise
concerns. Many editors begin their response with bold-font 'vote' of
support or opposition to make evaluation easier.

Closing a discussion requires careful evaluation of the responses to
determine the consensus. This does not require the intervention of an
administrator, but may be done by any sufficiently experienced impartial
editor, not involved in the discussion, who is familiar with all
policies and guidelines related to the proposal. The following points
are important in evaluating consensus:

  - [Consensus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus "wikilink")
    for guidelines and policies should be reasonably strong, though
    unanimity is not required.

  - There must be exposure to the community beyond just the authors of
    the proposal.

  - Consider the strength of the proposed page:

      - Have major concerns raised during the community discussion been
        addressed?
      - Does the proposal contradict any existing guidelines or
        policies?
      - Can the new proposed guideline or policy be merged into an
        existing one?
      - Is the proposed guideline or policy, or some part of it,
        redundant with an existing guideline or policy?

  - A proposal's status is not determined by counting votes. [Polling is
    not a substitute for
    discussion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Polling_is_not_a_substitute_for_discussion "wikilink"),
    nor is a poll's numerical outcome tantamount to consensus.

  - If consensus for broad community support has not developed after a
    reasonable time period, the proposal is considered failed. If
    consensus is neutral or unclear on the issue and unlikely to
    improve, the proposal has likewise failed.

Discussion may be closed as one of: **Promote**, **No consensus**, or
**Failed**. Please leave a short note about the conclusion that you came
to. Update the proposal to reflect the consensus. Remove the  template
and replace it with another appropriate template, such as , , , , or .
See [Wikipedia namespace
templates](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_messages/Wikipedia_namespace "wikilink")
for a listing of banners.

If a proposal fails, the failed tag should not usually be removed. It is
typically more productive to rewrite a failed proposal from scratch to
address problems, or seek consensus to integrate uncontroversial aspects
of it into existing pages, than to re-nominate a proposal.

## 降级

### Demotion

An accepted policy or guideline may become obsolete because of changes
in editorial practice or community standards, may become redundant
because of improvements to other pages, or may represent unwarranted
[instruction
creep](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_instruction_creep "wikilink").
In such situations editors may propose that a policy be demoted to a
guideline, or that a policy or guideline be demoted to a
[supplement](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Supplement "wikilink"),
[informational
page](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Information_page "wikilink"),
[essay](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Essay "wikilink") or
[historical](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Historical "wikilink")
page. In certain cases, a policy or guideline may be
[superseded](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Superseded "wikilink"),
in which case the old page is marked and retained for historical
interest.

The process for demotion is similar to promotion. A talk page discussion
is typically started, the  template is added to the top of the project
page, and community input is solicited. After a reasonable amount of
time for comments, an independent editor should close the discussion and
evaluate the consensus.

The  template is typically used instead of  for claims that a page was
recently assigned guideline or policy status without proper or
sufficient consensus being established.

Essays, information pages, and other informal pages that are only
supported by a small minority of the community are typically moved to
the primary author's userspace. These discussions typically happen on
the page's talk page, sometimes with an RfC, but they have at times also
been conducted at [Miscellany for
deletion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion "wikilink")
(despite the MFD guidelines explicitly discouraging this practice).
Other pages are retained for historical reference and are marked as
such.

## 变更内容

### Content changes

Policies and guidelines can be edited like any other Wikipedia page. It
is not strictly necessary to discuss changes or to obtain written
documentation of a consensus in advance. However, because policies and
guidelines are sensitive and complex, users should take care over any
edits, to be sure they are faithfully reflecting the community's view
and to be sure that they are not accidentally introducing new sources of
error or confusion.

Because Wikipedia practice exists in the community through
[consensus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus "wikilink"),
editing a policy/guideline/essay page does not in itself imply an
immediate change to accepted practice. It is, naturally, bad practice to
recommend a rejected practice on a policy or guideline page. To update
best practices, you may change the practice directly ([you are permitted
to deviate from practice for the purposes of such
change](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_"Ignore_all_rules"_means "wikilink"))
and/or set about building widespread consensus for your change or
implementation through discussion. When such a change is accepted, you
can then edit the page to reflect the new situation.

#### 重大变更

#### Substantive changes

**沟通。**

**Talk first.** Talk page discussion typically precedes substantive
changes to policy. Changes may be made if there are no objections, or if
discussion shows that there is consensus for the change. Minor edits to
improve formatting, grammar, and clarity may be made at any time.

If the result of discussions is unclear, then it should be evaluated by
an administrator or other independent editor, as in the proposal
process. Major changes should also be publicized to the community in
general; announcements similar to the proposal process may be
appropriate.

If wider input on a proposed change is desired, it may be useful to mark
the section with the tag . (If the proposal relates to a single
statement, use  immediately after it.)

**大胆修改。**

**Or be bold.** The older but still valid method is to boldly edit the
page.
[Bold](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold#Wikipedia_namespace "wikilink")
editors of policy and guideline pages are strongly encouraged to follow
[WP:1RR](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring#Other_revert_rules "wikilink")
or
[WP:0RR](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring#Other_revert_rules "wikilink")
standards. Although most editors find advance discussion, especially at
well-developed pages, very helpful, [directly editing these pages is
permitted by Wikipedia's
policies](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus#Reaching_consensus_through_editing "wikilink").
Consequently, you should not remove any change *solely* on the grounds
that there was no formal discussion indicating consensus for the change
before it was made. Instead, you should give a substantive reason for
challenging it and, if one hasn't already been started, open a
discussion to identify the community's current views.

Editing a policy to support your own argument in an active discussion
may be seen as [gaming the
system](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:gaming_the_system "wikilink"),
especially if you do not disclose your involvement in the argument when
making the edits.

### 建议之间的冲突

### Conflicts between advice pages

If policy and/or guideline pages directly conflict, one or more pages
need to be revised to resolve the conflict so that all of the
conflicting pages accurately reflect the community's actual practices
and best advice. As a temporary measure during that resolution process,
if a guideline appears to conflict with a policy, editors may assume
that the policy takes precedence.

More commonly, advice pages do not directly conflict, but provide
multiple options. For example, [WP:Identifying reliable
sources](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Identifying_reliable_sources "wikilink")
says that newspaper articles are generally considered to be reliable
sources, and [Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources
(medicine)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_\(medicine\) "wikilink")
recommends against newspaper articles for certain technical purposes.
Editors must use their best judgement to decide which advice is most
appropriate and relevant to the specific situation at hand.

1.  Many historical essays can still be found within [Meta's essay
    category](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:Meta:Category:Essays "wikilink").
    The Wikimedia Foundation's
    [Meta-wiki](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/meta: "wikilink") was
    envisioned as the original place for editors to comment on and
    discuss Wikipedia, although the "Wikipedia" project space has since
    taken over most of that role.
2.  There is no prohibition against including appropriate external
    references to support and explain our policies or guidelines, but
    such sources are not authoritative with respect to Wikipedia, and
    should only be used to reinforce consensus.
3.  [Office
    declarations](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Office_actions "wikilink")
    may establish unprecedented policies to avoid copyright, legal, or
    technical problems, though such declarations are rare.

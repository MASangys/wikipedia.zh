*'圓形素數*是[素數](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/素數 "wikilink")，具有在每個中間步驟週期性地置換其數字時生成的數字的屬性 (base 10) digits will be prime.\[1\]\[2\] For example, 1193 is a circular prime, since 1931, 9311 and 3119 all are also prime.\[3\] A circular prime with at least two digits can only consist of combinations of the digits 1, 3, 7 or 9, because having 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 as the last digit makes the number divisible by 2, and having 0 or 5 as the last digit makes it divisible by 5.\[4\]\[5\] The complete listing of the smallest representative prime from all known cycles of circular primes (The single-digit primes and [repunits](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/repunit "wikilink") are the only members of their respective cycles) is 2, 3, 5, 7, R<sub>2</sub>, 13, 17, 37, 79, 113, 197, 199, 337, 1193, 3779, 11939, 19937, 193939, 199933, R<sub>19</sub>, R<sub>23</sub>, R<sub>317</sub>, R<sub>1031</sub>, R<sub>49081</sub>, R<sub>86453</sub>, R<sub>109297</sub>, and R<sub>270343</sub>, where R<sub>*n*</sub> is a [repunit](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/repunit "wikilink") prime with *n* digits. There are no other circular primes up to 10<sup>23</sup>.\[6\] A type of prime related to the circular primes are the [permutable primes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/permutable_prime "wikilink"), which are a subset of the circular primes (every permutable prime is also a circular prime, but not necessarily vice versa).\[7\]

**圓錐角膜**（英語：**Keratoconus**，簡稱**KC**）是一種會造成[角膜](../Page/角膜.md "wikilink")持續變薄的[眼疾](../Page/人眼.md "wikilink")\[1\]，可能會導致 、[複視](../Page/复视.md "wikilink")、[近視](../Page/近視.md "wikilink")、[散光](../Page/散光.md "wikilink")和[對光敏感](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/感光性 "wikilink")\[2\]。患者通常雙眼都會受到影響\[3\]，較嚴重的患者角膜上會留下疤痕或棕綠色色素環\[4\]。

圓錐角膜的病因目前未明，但一般認為是[基因](../Page/基因.md "wikilink")、環境與[賀爾蒙等因素共同引起的疾病](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/賀爾蒙 "wikilink")\[5\]。約有7%的患者曾有家族病史\[6\]，可能的環境因素包括揉眼睛和過敏\[7\]，患者的角膜會逐漸變形成[角錐狀](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/角錐 "wikilink")\[8\]，藉由[裂隙燈即可檢查出來](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/裂隙燈 "wikilink")\[9\]。

疾病早期可以用[眼鏡](../Page/眼鏡.md "wikilink")或治療\[10\]，但當病情逐漸惡化，則需要使用特殊的隱形眼鏡\[11\]。多數患者前幾年沒有嚴重的視力問題，能保持病情穩定數年\[12\]；一小部分的患者則因為角膜結疤而需要進行\[13\]。

圓錐角膜的盛行率約2000分之一\[14\]\[15\]，多數罹病者為較年長的兒童和青壯年\[16\]。雖然各種族群都可能罹患，但在特定的族裔中（如亞裔）發生率似乎較高\[17\]。圓錐角膜的英文keratoconus來自[希臘語的](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/希腊语 "wikilink")*kéras*（意為角膜）和[拉丁語的](../Page/拉丁语.md "wikilink")*cōnus*（意為圓錐）\[18\]。

## 症狀和徵候

[Kc_simulation.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kc_simulation.jpg "fig:Kc_simulation.jpg") seen by a person with keratoconus.
"... a candle, when looked at, appears like a number of lights, confusedly running into one another" — Nottingham\[19\]\]\] People with early keratoconus typically notice a minor blurring of their vision and come to their clinician seeking corrective lenses for reading or driving.\[20\]\[21\] At early stages, the [symptoms](../Page/症狀.md "wikilink") of keratoconus may be no different from those of any other [refractive defect](../Page/眼屈光不正.md "wikilink") of the eye. As the disease progresses, vision deteriorates, sometimes rapidly. [Visual acuity](../Page/視力.md "wikilink") becomes impaired at all distances, and [night vision](../Page/夜視鏡.md "wikilink") is often poor. Some individuals have vision in one eye that is markedly worse than that in the other. The disease is often bilateral, though asymmetrical. Some develop  (sensitivity to bright light),  from squinting in order to read, or [itching](../Page/癢.md "wikilink") in the eye,\[22\] but there is normally little or no sensation of [pain](../Page/疼痛.md "wikilink"). It may cause luminous objects to appear as cylindrical pipes with the same intensity at all points.

The classic symptom of keratoconus is the perception of multiple "ghost" images, known as [monocular polyopia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/monocular_polyopia "wikilink"). This effect is most clearly seen with a high  field, such as a point of light on a dark background. Instead of seeing just one point, a person with keratoconus sees many images of the point, spread out in a chaotic pattern. This pattern does not typically change from day to day, but over time, it often takes on new forms. People also commonly notice streaking and  distortion around light sources. Some even notice the images moving relative to one another in time with their heart beat. The predominant [optical aberration](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/像差 "wikilink") of the eye in keratoconus is [coma](../Page/彗形像差.md "wikilink").\[23\]\[24\] The visual distortion experienced by the person comes from two sources, one being the irregular deformation of the surface of the cornea, and the other being scarring that occurs on its exposed highpoints. These factors act to form regions on the cornea that map an image to different locations on the [retina](../Page/视网膜.md "wikilink"). The effect can worsen in low light conditions, as the dark-adapted [pupil](../Page/瞳孔.md "wikilink") dilates to expose more of the irregular surface of the cornea.

## 遺傳學

Six genes have been found to be associated with the condition. These genes include , , , [FNDC3B](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/FNDC3B "wikilink"),  and .\[25\] Others likely also exist.\[26\]

## 病生理學

[David_G_Cogan_case_245_keratoconus_thin_stroma_wrinkled_endothelium.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:David_G_Cogan_case_245_keratoconus_thin_stroma_wrinkled_endothelium.png "fig:David_G_Cogan_case_245_keratoconus_thin_stroma_wrinkled_endothelium.png") Despite considerable research, the cause of keratoconus remains unclear.\[27\] Several sources suggest that keratoconus likely arises from a number of different factors: genetic, environmental or cellular, any of which may form the trigger for the onset of the disease.\[28\]\[29\]\[30\] Once initiated, the disease normally develops by progressive dissolution of ,\[31\] which lies between the corneal [epithelium](../Page/上皮組織.md "wikilink") and . As the two come into contact, cellular and structural changes in the cornea adversely affect its integrity and lead to the bulging and scarring characteristic of the disorder. Within any individual keratoconic cornea, regions of degenerative thinning coexisting with regions undergoing wound healing may be found. Scarring appears to be an aspect of the corneal degradation; however, a recent, large, multicenter study suggests abrasion by contact lenses may increase the likelihood of this finding by a factor over two.\[32\]\[33\]

A number of studies have indicated keratoconic corneas show signs of increased activity by [proteases](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/蛋白酶 "wikilink"),\[34\] a class of [enzymes](../Page/酶.md "wikilink") that break some of the [collagen](../Page/膠原蛋白.md "wikilink") cross-linkages in the stroma, with a simultaneous reduced [expression](../Page/基因表現.md "wikilink") of protease [inhibitors](../Page/酶抑制剂.md "wikilink").\[35\] Other studies have suggested that reduced activity by the enzyme  may be responsible for a build-up of [free radicals](../Page/自由基.md "wikilink") and oxidising species in the cornea.\[36\] Whatever the , the damage caused by activity within the cornea likely results in a reduction in its thickness and biomechanical strength. At an ultrastructural level the weakening of the corneal tissue is associated with a disruption of the regular arrangement of the collagen layers and collagen fibril orientation.\[37\] While keratoconus is considered a noninflammatory disorder, one study shows wearing rigid contact lenses by people leads to overexpression of proinflammatory [cytokines](../Page/细胞因子.md "wikilink"), such as , [TNF-alpha](../Page/肿瘤坏死因子-α.md "wikilink"), , and [VCAM-1](../Page/VCAM-1.md "wikilink") in the tear fluid.\[38\]

A genetic predisposition to keratoconus has been observed,\[39\] with the disease running in certain families,\[40\] and incidences reported of  in identical twins.\[41\] The frequency of occurrence in close family members is not clearly defined, though it is known to be considerably higher than that in the general population,\[42\] and studies have obtained estimates ranging between 6% and 19%.\[43\] Two studies involving isolated, largely homogenetic communities have contrarily mapped putative gene locations to [chromosomes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/染色体 "wikilink") 16q and 20q.\[44\] Most genetic studies agree on an [autosomal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/常染色体 "wikilink") [dominant](../Page/显性.md "wikilink") model of inheritance.\[45\] A rare, autosomal dominant form of severe keratoconus with anterior polar cataract is caused by a mutation in the seed region of , a microRNA that is highly expressed in the cornea and anterior lens.\[46\] Keratoconus is diagnosed more often in people with [Down's syndrome](../Page/唐氏综合征.md "wikilink"), though the reasons for this link have not yet been determined.\[47\]

Keratoconus has been associated with ,\[48\] which include [asthma](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/哮喘 "wikilink"), [allergies](../Page/过敏.md "wikilink"), and [eczema](../Page/皮膚炎.md "wikilink"), and it is not uncommon for several or all of these diseases to affect one person. Keratoconus is also associated with , [Down syndrome](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome "wikilink") and [Marfan syndrome](../Page/馬凡氏症候群.md "wikilink").\[49\] A number of studies suggest vigorous eye rubbing contributes to the progression of keratoconus, and people should be discouraged from the practice.\[50\]\[51\]\[52\]\[53\]\[54\]\[55\] Keratoconus differs from  which is caused by [LASIK](../Page/准分子激光原位角膜磨镶术.md "wikilink") eye surgery.  has been associated with the excessive removal of the eye's  tissue during surgery.

## 診斷 

[Keratoconus.svg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Keratoconus.svg "fig:Keratoconus.svg")\]\] [Computerised_Corneal_Topography.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Computerised_Corneal_Topography.jpg "fig:Computerised_Corneal_Topography.jpg") Prior to any [physical examination](../Page/理學檢查.md "wikilink"), the [diagnosis](../Page/诊断.md "wikilink") of keratoconus frequently begins with an [ophthalmologist](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/眼科学 "wikilink")'s or [optometrist](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/视光学 "wikilink")'s assessment of the person's [medical history](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/病史 "wikilink"), particularly the [chief complaint](../Page/主訴.md "wikilink") and other visual symptoms, the presence of any history of ocular disease or injury which might affect vision, and the presence of any family history of ocular disease. An [eye chart](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/eye_chart "wikilink"), such as a standard  of , is then used to determine the person's [visual acuity](../Page/視力.md "wikilink"). The [eye examination](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/視力測試 "wikilink") may proceed to measurement of the localized curvature of the cornea with a manual ,\[56\] with detection of irregular [astigmatism](../Page/散光.md "wikilink") suggesting a possibility of keratoconus. Severe cases can exceed the instrument's measuring ability.\[57\] A further indication can be provided by , in which a light beam is focused on the person's retina and the reflection, or reflex, observed as the examiner tilts the light source back and forth. Keratoconus is amongst the ophthalmic conditions that exhibit a scissor reflex action of two bands moving toward and away from each other like the blades of a pair of [scissors](../Page/剪刀.md "wikilink").\[58\]\[59\]

If keratoconus is suspected, the ophthalmologist or optometrist will search for other characteristic findings of the disease by means of [slit lamp](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/裂隙灯 "wikilink") examination of the cornea.\[60\] An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner, and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing. Under close examination, a ring of yellow-brown to olive-green pigmentation known as a  can be observed in around half of keratoconic eyes.\[61\] The Fleischer ring, caused by deposition of the iron oxide  within the corneal epithelium, is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases, but becomes more evident when viewed under a [cobalt blue](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/鈷藍色 "wikilink") filter.\[62\] Similarly, around 50% of subjects exhibit Vogt's , fine stress lines within the cornea caused by stretching and thinning.\[63\] The striae temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball.\[64\] A highly pronounced cone can create a V-shaped indentation in the lower [eyelid](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/眼睑 "wikilink") when the person's gaze is directed downwards, known as .\[65\] Other [clinical signs](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/醫學徵象 "wikilink") of keratoconus will normally have presented themselves long before Munson's sign becomes apparent,\[66\] and so this finding, though a classic sign of the disease, tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance.

A handheld , sometimes known as "Placido's disk", can provide a simple  visualization of the surface of the cornea by projecting a series of concentric rings of light onto the cornea. A more definitive diagnosis can be obtained using , in which an automated instrument projects the illuminated pattern onto the cornea and determines its topography from analysis of the digital image. The topographical map indicates any distortions or scarring in the cornea, with keratoconus revealed by a characteristic steepening of curvature which is usually below the centreline of the eye.\[67\] The technique can record a snapshot of the degree and extent of the deformation as a benchmark for assessing its rate of progression. It is of particular value in detecting the disorder in its early stages when other signs have not yet presented.\[68\]

  - The steepness of greatest curvature from 'mild' (\< 45 [D](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/屈光度 "wikilink")), 'advanced' (up to 52 [D](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/屈光度 "wikilink")) or 'severe' (\> 52 [D](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/屈光度 "wikilink"));
  - The morphology of the cone: 'nipple' (small: 5 mm and near-central), 'oval' (larger, below-center and often sagging), or 'globus' (more than 75% of cornea affected);
  - The corneal thickness from mild (\> 506 μm) to advanced (\< 446 μm).

Increasing use of corneal topography has led to a decline in use of these terms.\[70\]

## 治療

### 眼鏡和隱形眼鏡

[KC-lens.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KC-lens.jpg "fig:KC-lens.jpg") In early stages of keratoconus, [glasses](../Page/眼鏡.md "wikilink") or soft [contact lenses](../Page/隱形眼鏡.md "wikilink") can suffice to correct for the mild astigmatism. As the condition progresses, these may no longer provide the person with a satisfactory degree of visual acuity, and most practitioners will move to manage the condition with rigid contact lenses, known as , (RGP) lenses. RGP lenses provide a good level of visual correction, but do not arrest progression of the condition.\[74\]

In people with keratoconus, rigid contact lenses improve vision by means of [tear fluid](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/淚 "wikilink") filling the gap between the irregular corneal surface and the smooth regular inner surface of the lens, thereby creating the effect of a smoother cornea. Many specialized types of contact lenses have been developed for keratoconus, and affected people may seek out both doctors specialized in conditions of the cornea, and contact lens fitters who have experience managing people with keratoconus. The irregular cone presents a challenge\[75\] and the fitter will endeavor to produce a lens with the optimal contact, stability and steepness. Some trial-and-error fitting may prove necessary.\[76\]

#### 混合鏡

Traditionally, contact lenses for keratoconus have been the 'hard' or RGP variety, although manufacturers have also produced specialized 'soft' or [hydrophilic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/親水性 "wikilink") lenses and, most recently, silicone hydrogel lenses. A soft lens has a tendency to conform to the conical shape of the cornea, thus diminishing its effect. To counter this, hybrid lenses have been developed which are hard in the centre and encompassed by a soft skirt. However, soft or earlier generation hybrid lenses did not prove effective for every person.\[77\] Early generation lenses have been discontinued.\[78\] The fourth generation of hybrid lens technology has improved, giving more people an option that combines the comfort of a soft lens with the visual acuity of an RGP lens.\[79\]

#### 鞏膜鏡 

[Scleral_lens_worn_on_an_eye.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scleral_lens_worn_on_an_eye.jpg "fig:Scleral_lens_worn_on_an_eye.jpg") Scleral lenses are sometimes prescribed for cases of advanced or very irregular keratoconus; these lenses cover a greater proportion of the surface of the eye and hence can offer improved stability.\[80\] Easier handling can find favor with people with reduced , such as the elderly.

#### 肩背式系統

Some people find good vision correction and comfort with a "piggyback" lens combination, in which RGP lenses are worn over soft lenses, both providing a degree of vision correction.\[81\] One form of piggyback lens makes use of a soft lens with a countersunk central area to accept the rigid lens. Fitting a piggyback lens combination requires experience on the part of the lens fitter, and tolerance on the part of the person with keratoconus.

### 手術

#### 角膜移植

[Cornea_transplant.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cornea_transplant.jpg "fig:Cornea_transplant.jpg") [Cornea_Transplant.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cornea_Transplant.jpg "fig:Cornea_Transplant.jpg") Between 11% and 27% of cases of keratoconus\[82\]\[83\]\[84\] will progress to a point where vision correction is no longer possible, thinning of the cornea becomes excessive, or scarring as a result of contact lens wear causes problems of its own, and a corneal transplantation or penetrating keratoplasty becomes required. Keratoconus is the most common grounds for conducting a penetrating keratoplasty, generally accounting for around a quarter of such procedures.\[85\] The corneal transplant surgeon s a lenticule of corneal tissue and then  the [donor](../Page/器官捐贈.md "wikilink") cornea to the existing eye tissue, usually using a combination of running and individual [sutures](../Page/手术缝合线.md "wikilink"). The cornea does not have a direct blood supply, so the donor tissue is not required to be [blood type](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/血型 "wikilink") matched. s check the donor corneas for any disease or cellular irregularities.

The acute recovery period can take four to six weeks, and full postoperative vision stabilization often takes a year or more, but most transplants are very stable in the long term.\[86\] The  reports that penetrating keratoplasty has the most successful outcome of all transplant procedures, and when performed for keratoconus in an otherwise healthy eye, its success rate can be 95% or greater.\[87\] The sutures used usually dissolve over a period of three to five years, but individual sutures can be removed during the healing process if they are causing irritation to the person.

In the US, corneal transplants (also known as corneal grafts) for keratoconus are usually performed under sedation as [outpatient](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/患者 "wikilink") surgery. In other countries, such as Australia and the UK, the operation is commonly performed with the person undergoing a general anaesthetic. All cases require a careful follow-up with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) for a number of years. Frequently, vision is greatly improved after the surgery, but even if the actual visual acuity does not improve, because the cornea is a more normal shape after the healing is completed, people can more easily be fitted with corrective lenses. Complications of corneal transplants are mostly related to vascularization of the corneal tissue and [rejection](../Page/移植排斥.md "wikilink") of the donor cornea. [Vision loss](../Page/視力受損.md "wikilink") is very rare, though difficult-to-correct vision is possible. When rejection is severe, repeat transplants are often attempted, and are frequently successful.\[88\] Keratoconus will not normally reoccur in the transplanted cornea; incidences of this have been observed, but are usually attributed to incomplete excision of the original cornea or inadequate screening of the donor tissue.\[89\] The long-term outlook for corneal transplants performed for keratoconus is usually favorable once the initial healing period is completed and a few years have elapsed without problems.

One way of reducing the risk of rejection is to use a technique called deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). In a DALK graft, only the outermost epithelium and the main bulk of the cornea, the stroma, are replaced; the person's rearmost  layer and the  are left, giving some additional structural integrity to the postgraft cornea.\[90\] Furthermore, it is possible to transplant [freeze-dried](../Page/冷凍乾燥.md "wikilink") donor tissue. The freeze-drying process ensures this tissue is dead, so there is no chance of rejection.\[91\] Research from two trials in Iran provide low to moderate evidence that graft rejection is more likely to occur in penetrating keratoplasty than in DALK, though the likelihood for graft failure were similar with both procedures.\[92\]

##### 上角膜成形術

Rarely, a nonpenetrating keratoplasty known as an epikeratophakia (or epikeratoplasty) may be performed in cases of keratoconus. The corneal epithelium is removed and a lenticule of donor cornea is grafted on top of it.\[93\] The procedure requires a greater level of skill on the part of the surgeon, and is less frequently performed than a penetrating keratoplasty, as the outcome is generally less favorable. However, it may be seen as an option in a number of cases, particularly for young people.\[94\]

#### 角膜環移植

[IntacsAfterInsertion.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IntacsAfterInsertion.jpg "fig:IntacsAfterInsertion.jpg") A possible surgical alternative to corneal transplant is the insertion of intrastromal corneal ring segments. A small incision is made in the periphery of the cornea and two thin arcs of [polymethyl methacrylate](../Page/聚甲基丙烯酸甲酯.md "wikilink") are slid between the layers of the stroma on either side of the [pupil](../Page/瞳孔.md "wikilink") before the incision is closed by a suture.\[95\] The segments push out against the curvature of the cornea, flattening the peak of the cone and returning it to a more natural shape. The procedure offers the benefit of being reversible and even potentially exchangeable as it involves no removal of eye tissue.\[96\]\[97\]

#### 角膜膠原交聯手術

is a developing treatment which aims to strengthen the cornea, however, according to a 2015 Cochrane review, there is insufficient evidence to determine if it is useful in keratoconus.\[98\]

#### 放射狀角膜切開術

[Mini_Asymmetric_Radial_Keratotomy_-_MARK.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mini_Asymmetric_Radial_Keratotomy_-_MARK.jpg "fig:Mini_Asymmetric_Radial_Keratotomy_-_MARK.jpg")

is a [refractive surgery](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/激光矯視 "wikilink") procedure where the surgeon makes a spoke-like pattern of incisions into the cornea to modify its shape. This early surgical option for [myopia](../Page/近視.md "wikilink") has been largely superseded by [LASIK](../Page/准分子激光原位角膜磨镶术.md "wikilink") and other similar procedures. LASIK is absolutely contraindicated in keratoconus and other corneal thinning conditions as removal of corneal stromal tissue will further damage an already thin and weak cornea.\[99\] For similar reasons, radial keratotomy has also generally not been used for people with keratoconus.\[100\]\[101\]

## 預後

[David_G_Cogan_collection_Case_244_photo_2_keratoconus_Descemet_rupture.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:David_G_Cogan_collection_Case_244_photo_2_keratoconus_Descemet_rupture.png "fig:David_G_Cogan_collection_Case_244_photo_2_keratoconus_Descemet_rupture.png") Patients with keratoconus typically present initially with mild [astigmatism](../Page/散光.md "wikilink") and myopia, commonly at the onset of [puberty](../Page/青春期.md "wikilink"), and are diagnosed by the late teenage years or early 20s. The disease can, however, present or progress at any age; in rare cases, keratoconus can present in children or not until later adulthood.\[102\] A diagnosis of the disease at an early age may indicate a greater risk of severity in later life.\[103\]\[104\] Patients' vision will seem to fluctuate over a period of months, driving them to change lens prescriptions frequently, but as the condition worsens, [contact lenses](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/contact_lens "wikilink") are required in the majority of cases. The course of the disorder can be quite variable, with some patients remaining stable for years or indefinitely, while others progress rapidly or experience occasional exacerbations over a long and otherwise steady course. Most commonly, keratoconus progresses for a period of 10 to 20 years\[105\] before the course of the disease generally ceases in the third and fourth decades of life.

### 角膜脫垂

[Hydrops_(descemets_membrane_rupture)_due_to_keratoconus.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hydrops_\(descemets_membrane_rupture\)_due_to_keratoconus.jpg "fig:Hydrops_(descemets_membrane_rupture)_due_to_keratoconus.jpg") In advanced cases, bulging of the cornea can result in a localized rupture of , an inner layer of the cornea. [Aqueous humor](../Page/房水.md "wikilink") from the eye's  seeps into the cornea before Descemet's membrane reseals. The patient experiences pain and a sudden severe clouding of vision, with the cornea taking on a translucent milky-white appearance known as a corneal hydrops.\[106\]

Although disconcerting to the patient, the effect is normally temporary and after a period of six to eight weeks, the cornea usually returns to its former transparency. The recovery can be aided nonsurgically by bandaging with an [osmotic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/渗透 "wikilink") [saline](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/生理盐水 "wikilink") solution. Although a hydrops usually causes increased scarring of the cornea, occasionally it will benefit a patient by creating a flatter cone, aiding the fitting of contact lenses.\[107\] Corneal transplantation is not usually indicated during corneal hydrops.

## 流行病學

The  reports keratoconus is the most common  in the United States, affecting about one in 2,000 Americans,\[108\]\[109\] but some reports place the figure as high as one in 500.\[110\] The inconsistency may be due to variations in diagnostic criteria,\[111\] with some cases of severe astigmatism interpreted as those of keratoconus, and'' vice versa''.\[112\] A long-term study found a mean incidence rate of 2.0 new cases per 100,000 population per year.\[113\] Some studies have suggested a higher prevalence amongst females,\[114\] or that people of South Asian ethnicity are 4.4 times as likely to suffer from keratoconus as Caucasians, and are also more likely to be affected with the condition earlier.\[115\]

Keratoconus is normally bilateral\[116\] (affecting both eyes) although the distortion is usually asymmetric and is rarely completely identical in both corneas.\[117\] Unilateral cases tend to be uncommon, and may in fact be very rare if a very mild condition in the better eye is simply below the limit of clinical detection.\[118\] It is common for keratoconus to be diagnosed first in one eye and not until later in the other. As the condition then progresses in both eyes, the vision in the earlier-diagnosed eye will often remain poorer than that in its fellow.

## 歷史

[Conicalcornea.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Conicalcornea.jpg "fig:Conicalcornea.jpg") The German [oculist](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/眼科学 "wikilink")  provided an early description in a 1748 doctoral dissertation of a case of keratoconus,\[119\] which he called *staphyloma diaphanum*. However, it was not until 1854 that British physician John Nottingham (1801–1856) clearly described keratoconus and distinguished it from other s of the cornea.\[120\] Nottingham reported the cases of "conical cornea" that had come to his attention, and described several classic features of the disease, including [polyopia](../Page/复视.md "wikilink"), weakness of the cornea, and difficulty matching corrective lenses to the patient's vision.\[121\] In 1859, British surgeon  used an  (recently invented by [Hermann von Helmholtz](../Page/赫尔曼·冯·亥姆霍兹.md "wikilink")) to diagnose keratoconus, and described how to angle the instrument's mirror so as to best see the conical shape of the cornea.\[122\] Bowman also attempted to restore vision by pulling on the [iris](../Page/虹膜.md "wikilink") with a fine hook inserted through the cornea and stretching the [pupil](../Page/瞳孔.md "wikilink") into a vertical slit, like that of a cat. He reported that he had had a measure of success with the technique, restoring vision to an 18-year-old woman who had previously been unable to count fingers at a distance of 8 inches (20 cm).

By 1869, when the pioneering Swiss ophthalmologist  wrote a thesis entitled *On the treatment of keratoconus*,\[123\] the disorder had acquired its current name. The treatment at that time, endorsed by the leading German ophthalmologist , was an attempt to physically reshape the cornea by chemical cauterization with a [silver nitrate](../Page/硝酸银.md "wikilink") solution and application of a -causing agent with a pressure dressing.\[124\] In 1888, the treatment of keratoconus became one of the first practical applications of the then newly invented [contact lens](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/contact_lens "wikilink"), when the French physician  manufactured a glass scleral shell that improved vision by compressing the cornea into a more regular shape.\[125\] Since the start of the 20th century, research on keratoconus has both improved understanding of the disease and greatly expanded the range of treatment options. The first successful corneal transplantation to treat keratoconus was done in 1936 by .\[126\]\[127\]

### 花費

According to the findings of the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus (CLEK), people who have keratoconus could be expected to pay more than $25,000 over their lifetime post-diagnosis, with a standard deviation of $19,396.\[128\] There is limited evidence on the costs of ,\[129\] a cost-effectiveness study estimated the costs of the total treatment for one person as £928 ($1,392 U.S.) in the UK [National Health Service](../Page/國民保健署_\(英國\).md "wikilink"),\[130\] but this may be as high as $2,500 per eye in other countries.\[131\] A 2013 cost-benefit analysis by the [Lewin Group](../Page/聯合健康保險.md "wikilink") for Eye Bank Association of America, estimated an average cost of $16,500 for each .\[132\]

Several other  also cause thinning of the cornea:\[133\]

  - is a very rare condition that causes corneal thinning primarily at the margins, resulting in a spherical, slightly enlarged eye. It may be genetically related to keratoconus.\[134\]

  - causes thinning of a narrow (1–2 mm) band of the cornea, usually along the inferior corneal margin. It causes irregular astigmatism that, in the early stages of the disease can be corrected by spectacles. Differential diagnosis may be made by slit-lamp examination.\[135\]\[136\]

  - Posterior keratoconus, a distinct disorder despite its similar name, is a rare abnormality, usually congenital, which causes a nonprogressive thinning of the inner surface of the cornea, while the curvature of the anterior surface remains normal. Usually only a single eye is affected.\[137\]

  - is a complication of [LASIK](../Page/准分子激光原位角膜磨镶术.md "wikilink") eye surgery.

## 早年經歷

After graduating from Oxford, Parit wanted to work in Thai politics.
However, the country was still under military rule and there were no
planned elections. Instead, he became a consultant for the firm
[McKinsey](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company "wikilink"),
working on various projects in the Southeast Asia region.\[7\]

## 政治生涯

In 2018, Parit left his job at McKinsey and returned to Thailand to
start his career in Thai politics. He joined the [Democrat
Party](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrat_Party_\(Thailand\) "wikilink")
and affirmed his desire to run for office to become a member of the
House of Representatives.

While waiting for the military junta to declare elections, Parit hosted
and co-produced a TV series *"Hen Kub Ta"* (เห็นกับตา; lit: "see with
eyes") on [PPTV HD](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPTV_HD "wikilink"),
starting May 4, 2018.\[8\] The show consisted of him trying out
different jobs (such as garbage collector) in each episode.

He also co-founded the "New Dem" group within the Democrat Party, with
the goals of ushering in a new generation of Democrat politicians.

On December 26, 2018 he was assigned to be a candidate in Bangkok's 13rd
constituency, consisting of [Bang
Kapi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_Kapi "wikilink") and [Wang
Thonglang](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Thonglang "wikilink")
(only Phlabphla) in the [2019 general
election](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Thai_general_election "wikilink").\[9\]
The seat was previously held by Nat Bantadtan (son of previous Democrat
leader, Bunyat Bantadtan) and is considered a strong Democrat
constituency. Generally, first time candidates like Parit are not
assigned to run in safe seats as these seats are reserved for incumbents
or more senior party members.

However, the Democrat Party faced a devastating defeat in the 2019
election, losing all its seats in Bangkok, which is traditionally a
Democrat stronghold. Parit, who ran in Bangkok's 13th constituency, came
in 4th place.\[10\]

### 2019年大選後

After news reports that senior members of the party planned to join
[Palang
Pracharath](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palang_Pracharath_Party "wikilink")'s,
the pro-junta party, coalition, Parit and his New Dem colleagues came
out against this move, citing the party's campaign promise that it won't
back Gen. Prayut and support the junta's continuation of power. Instead,
Parit urged the party to organize an open primary where the party's
members and non-members could vote on the party's future.

Parit stated in interviews that he remains committed to working in
politics and wants to dedicate his whole life to the Democrat Party.

## 個人生活

Parit is known for his relationship with the [Channel
3](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_3_\(Thailand\) "wikilink")'s
actress [Nuttanicha "Nychaa"
Dungwattanawanich](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuttanicha_Dungwattanawanich "wikilink").
They were together for three years before they broke up in 2017.\[11\]

**廣義相對論所使用的數學**很複雜。[牛頓的運動理論中](../Page/艾萨克·牛顿.md "wikilink")，物體做[加速度運動時](../Page/加速度.md "wikilink")，其長度和時間流逝的速率保持定值，這表示[牛頓力學中的許多問題用](../Page/经典力学.md "wikilink")[代數就能解決](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/代數 "wikilink")。然而，[相對論中的物體在運動速度接近](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/相對論 "wikilink")[光速時](../Page/光速.md "wikilink")，長度和時間流逝的速率會有可觀的改變，這表示要計算物體的運動必須用上更多變數和複雜的數學，如[向量](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/向量空間 "wikilink")、[張量](../Page/張量.md "wikilink")、[偽張量](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/偽張量 "wikilink")、等概念。

## 向量與張量

### 向量

[Vector_by_Zureks.svg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vector_by_Zureks.svg "fig:Vector_by_Zureks.svg")

在[數學](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/數學 "wikilink")、[物理學及](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/物理學 "wikilink")[工程學中](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/工程學 "wikilink")，歐幾里得向量（有時也稱為「幾何向量」\[1\]、「空間向量」\[2\]，或單稱「向量」）是同時有[量值](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/量_\(数学\) "wikilink")（[長度](../Page/范数.md "wikilink")）和方向的幾何對象。一個向量將\(A\)點「搬運」至\(B\)點；向量的拉丁文「vector」意思為「搬運東西的東西」。\[3\]向量的量值就是兩點之間的距離，方向則為\(A\)到\(B\)的位移方向。很多[實數的](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/實數 "wikilink")，像[加](../Page/加法.md "wikilink")、[減](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/減法 "wikilink")、[乘](../Page/乘法.md "wikilink")、[邏輯非](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/邏輯非 "wikilink")，和向量的運算很類似，運算也遵守相似的代數法則，如[交換律](../Page/交換律.md "wikilink")、[結合律](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/結合律 "wikilink")、[分配律](../Page/分配律.md "wikilink")。

### 張量

[Components_stress_tensor_cartesian.svg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Components_stress_tensor_cartesian.svg "fig:Components_stress_tensor_cartesian.svg")

張量將向量的概念延伸至額外的維度。[純量是沒有方向的量](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/标量_\(数学\) "wikilink")，是單純的數字，在圖上以點來表示，是零維的物件。向量則有量值和方向，在圖上以線呈現，是一維的物件。張量延伸了向量的概念，一個二維的張量稱為二階張量，可以看成一組相關的向量，在一個平面上的多個方向移動。

### 應用

向量在物理科學裡很基礎。他們可用來代表所有同時有量值和方向的量，例如[速度](../Page/速度.md "wikilink")。速度的量值為[速率](../Page/速率.md "wikilink")。舉例而言，每秒五公尺向上的速度可以向量（0,
5）表示（在二維以\(y\)軸的正方向表示向上）。[力的量也能以向量表示](../Page/力.md "wikilink")，因為它有量值和方向。向量也能描述很多其他的物理量，如[位移](../Page/位移.md "wikilink")、[加速度](../Page/加速度.md "wikilink")、[動量和](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/動量 "wikilink")[角動量](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/角動量 "wikilink")。其他物理向量，如[電場和](../Page/電場.md "wikilink")[磁場](../Page/磁場.md "wikilink")，以物理空間中所有點的向量系統表示，也就是[向量場](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/向量場 "wikilink")。

張量在物理中也有延伸應用：

  - [电磁学中的](../Page/电磁学.md "wikilink")[電磁張量](../Page/電磁張量.md "wikilink")（或法拉第張量）
  - 在[连续介质力学中的](../Page/连续介质力学.md "wikilink")[形變描述形變和](../Page/形變.md "wikilink")[應變張量的有限應變張量](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/应变_\(物理学\) "wikilink")
  - [电容率和](../Page/电容率.md "wikilink")[電極化率是](../Page/電極化率.md "wikilink")[各向异性介質中的張量](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/各向异性 "wikilink")
  - [廣義相對論中的](../Page/廣義相對論.md "wikilink")[應力-能量張量](../Page/應力-能量張量.md "wikilink")，用來表示[动量的](../Page/动量.md "wikilink")[通量](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/通量 "wikilink")
  - 球張量算符是[球座標系中量子](../Page/球座標系.md "wikilink")[角動量算符的特徵函數](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/角動量 "wikilink")
  - 擴散張量是[擴散磁振造影的基礎](../Page/擴散磁振造影.md "wikilink")，代表生物環境中的擴散率

### 維度

廣義相對論需要用到[四維向量](../Page/四維矢量.md "wikilink")，或稱四向量。這四維為長、寬、高、時間。其中的「點」代表事件，因為它同時包含地點和時間。類似向量，相對論中的張量也需要四維。其中一個例子就是[黎曼曲率張量](../Page/黎曼曲率張量.md "wikilink")。

### 座標轉換

In physics, as well as mathematics, a vector is often identified with a
[tuple](../Page/多元组.md "wikilink"), or list of numbers, which depend on
some auxiliary coordinate system or [reference
frame](../Page/参考系.md "wikilink"). When the coordinates are
transformed, for example by rotation or stretching of the coordinate
system, then the components of the vector also transform. The vector
itself has not changed, but the reference frame has, so the components
of the vector (or measurements taken with respect to the reference
frame) must change to compensate.

The vector is called [*covariant* or
*contravariant*](../Page/共變和反變.md "wikilink") depending on how
the transformation of the vector's components is related to the
transformation of coordinates.

  - Contravariant vectors are "regular vectors" with units of distance
    (such as a displacement) or distance times some other unit (such as
    velocity or acceleration). For example, in changing units from
    meters to millimeters, a displacement of 1 m becomes 1000 mm.
  - Covariant vectors, on the other hand, have units of
    one-over-distance (typically such as
    [gradient](../Page/梯度.md "wikilink")). For example, in changing
    again from meters to millimeters, a gradient of
    1 [K](../Page/开尔文.md "wikilink")/m becomes 0.001 K/mm.

In [Einstein notation](../Page/爱因斯坦求和约定.md "wikilink"), contravariant
vectors and components of tensors are shown with superscripts, e.g. ,
and covariant vectors and components of tensors with subscripts, e.g. .
Indices are "raised" or "lowered" by multiplication by an appropriate
matrix, often the identity matrix.

Coordinate transformation is important because relativity states that
there is no one correct reference point in the universe. On earth, we
use dimensions like north, east, and elevation, which are used
throughout the entire planet. There is no such system for space. Without
a clear reference grid, it becomes more accurate to describe the four
dimensions as towards/away, left/right, up/down and past/future. As an
example event, take the signing of the [Declaration of
Independence](../Page/美國獨立宣言.md "wikilink"). To a modern observer on
[Mount Rainier](../Page/瑞尼爾山.md "wikilink") looking east, the event is
ahead, to the right, below, and in the past. However, to an observer in
medieval England looking north, the event is behind, to the left,
neither up nor down, and in the future. The event itself has not
changed, the location of the observer has.

## 斜軸

An oblique coordinate system is one in which the axes are not
necessarily [orthogonal](../Page/正交.md "wikilink") to each other; that
is, they meet at angles other than [right
angles](../Page/直角.md "wikilink"). When using coordinate
transformations as described above, the new coordinate system will often
appear to have oblique axes compared to the old system.

## 非張量

A nontensor is a tensor-like quantity that behaves like a tensor in the
raising and lowering of indices, but that does not transform like a
tensor under a coordinate transformation. For example, [Christoffel
symbols](../Page/克里斯托费尔符号.md "wikilink") cannot be tensors themselves if
the coordinates don't change in a linear way.

In general relativity, one cannot describe the energy and momentum of
the gravitational field by an energy–momentum tensor. Instead, one
introduces objects that behave as tensors only with respect to
restricted coordinate transformations. Strictly speaking, such objects
are not tensors at all. A famous example of such a pseudotensor is the .

## 曲線座標和彎曲時空

[Cassini-science-br.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cassini-science-br.jpg "fig:Cassini-science-br.jpg")
space probe (artist's impression): radio signals sent between the Earth
and the probe (green wave) are [delayed](../Page/引力时间延迟效应.md "wikilink")
by the warping of [space and time](../Page/时空.md "wikilink") (blue
lines) due to the [Sun](../Page/太阳.md "wikilink")'s mass. That is, the
Sun's mass causes the regular grid coordinate system (in blue) to
distort and have curvature. The radio wave then follows this curvature
and moves toward the Sun.\]\]

are coordinates in which the angles between axes can change from point
to point. This means that rather than having a grid of straight lines,
the grid instead has curvature.

A good example of this is the surface of the Earth. While maps
frequently portray north, south, east and west as a simple square grid,
that is not in fact the case. Instead, the longitude lines running north
and south are curved and meet at the north pole. This is because the
Earth is not flat, but instead round.

In general relativity, gravity has curvature effects on the four
dimensions of the universe. A common analogy is placing a heavy object
on a stretched out rubber sheet, causing the sheet to bend downward.
This curves the coordinate system around the object, much like an object
in the universe curves the coordinate system it sits in. The mathematics
here are conceptually more complex than on Earth, as it results in [four
dimensions](../Page/四维空间.md "wikilink") of curved coordinates instead of
three as used to describe a curved 2D surface.

## 平行移動

[parallel_displacement.svg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:parallel_displacement.svg "fig:parallel_displacement.svg")

### 高維空間中的區間

In a [Euclidean space](../Page/欧几里得空间.md "wikilink"), the separation
between two points is measured by the distance between the two points.
The distance is purely spatial, and is always positive. In spacetime,
the separation between two events is measured by the *invariant
interval* between the two events, which takes into account not only the
spatial separation between the events, but also their temporal
separation. The interval, , between two events is defined as:

\[s^2 = \Delta r^2 - c^2\Delta t^2 \,\](spacetime interval),

where  is the speed of light, and  and  denote differences of the space
and time coordinates, respectively, between the events. The choice of
signs for  above follows the . A notation like  means . The reason  is
called the interval and not  is that  can be positive, zero or negative.

Spacetime intervals may be classified into three distinct types, based
on whether the temporal separation () or the spatial separation () of
the two events is greater: time-like, light-like or space-like.

Certain types of [world lines](../Page/世界线.md "wikilink") are called
[geodesics](../Page/测地线.md "wikilink") of the spacetime – straight lines
in the case of Minkowski space and their closest equivalent in the
curved spacetime of general relativity. In the case of purely time-like
paths, geodesics are (locally) the paths of greatest separation
(spacetime interval) as measured along the path between two events,
whereas in Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds, geodesics are paths
of shortest distance between two points.\[4\]\[5\] The concept of
geodesics becomes central in [general
relativity](../Page/廣義相對論.md "wikilink"), since geodesic
motion may be thought of as "pure motion" ([inertial
motion](../Page/慣性力.md "wikilink")) in spacetime, that is, free
from any external influences.

### 協變導數

The covariant derivative is a generalization of the directional
derivative from vector calculus. As with the directional derivative, the
covariant derivative is a rule, which takes as its inputs: (1) a vector,
, (along which the derivative is taken) defined at a point , and (2) a
vector field, , defined in a neighborhood of . The output is a vector,
also at the point . The primary difference from the usual directional
derivative is that the covariant derivative must, in a certain precise
sense, be independent of the manner in which it is expressed in a
coordinate system.

### 平行移動

Given the covariant derivative, one can define the [parallel
transport](../Page/平行移动.md "wikilink") of a vector  at a point  along a
curve  starting at . For each point  of , the parallel transport of  at
will be a function of , and can be written as , where  **v**}}. The
function  is determined by the requirement that the covariant derivative
of  along  is 0. This is similar to the fact that a constant function is
one whose derivative is constantly 0.

### 克里斯多福符號

The equation for the covariant derivative can be written in terms of
Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols find frequent use in
Einstein's theory of [general relativity](../Page/廣義相對論.md "wikilink"),
where [spacetime](../Page/时空.md "wikilink") is represented by a curved
4-dimensional [Lorentz manifold](../Page/伪黎曼流形.md "wikilink") with a
[Levi-Civita connection](../Page/列维-奇维塔联络.md "wikilink"). The [Einstein
field equations](../Page/爱因斯坦场方程.md "wikilink") – which determine the
geometry of spacetime in the presence of matter – contain the [Ricci
tensor](../Page/里奇曲率張量.md "wikilink"). Since the Ricci tensor is derived
from the Riemann tensor, which can be written in terms of Christoffel
symbols, a calculation of the Christoffel symbols is essential. Once the
geometry is determined, the paths of particles and light beams are
calculated by  in which the Christoffel symbols explicitly appear.

## 測地線

In [general relativity](../Page/廣義相對論.md "wikilink"), a **geodesic**
generalizes the notion of a "straight line" to curved
[spacetime](../Page/时空.md "wikilink"). Importantly, the [world
line](../Page/世界线.md "wikilink") of a particle free from all external,
non-gravitational force, is a particular type of geodesic. In other
words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a
geodesic.

In general relativity, gravity can be regarded as not a force but a
consequence of a curved spacetime geometry where the source of curvature
is the [stress–energy tensor](../Page/應力-能量張量.md "wikilink")
(representing matter, for instance). Thus, for example, the path of a
planet orbiting around a star is the projection of a geodesic of the
curved 4-dimensional spacetime geometry around the star onto
3-dimensional space.

A curve is a geodesic if the  of the curve at any point is equal to the
[parallel transport](../Page/平行移动.md "wikilink") of the  of the base
point.

## 曲率張量

The Riemann tensor tells us, mathematically, how much curvature there is
in any given region of space. Contracting the tensor produces 3
different mathematical objects:

1.  The [Riemann curvature tensor](../Page/黎曼曲率張量.md "wikilink"): ,
    which gives the most information on the curvature of a space and is
    derived from derivatives of the [metric
    tensor](../Page/度量张量.md "wikilink"). In flat space this
    tensor is zero.
2.  The [Ricci tensor](../Page/里奇曲率張量.md "wikilink"): , comes from the
    need in Einstein's theory for a curvature tensor with only 2
    indices. It is obtained by averaging certain portions of the Riemann
    curvature tensor.
3.  The [scalar curvature](../Page/数量曲率.md "wikilink"): , the simplest
    measure of curvature, assigns a single scalar value to each point in
    a space. It is obtained by averaging the Ricci tensor.

The Riemann curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of the covariant
derivative.

The Einstein tensor  is a rank-2 [tensor](../Page/張量.md "wikilink")
defined over [pseudo-Riemannian manifolds](../Page/伪黎曼流形.md "wikilink").
In index-free notation it is defined as

\[\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{R}-\tfrac12\mathbf{g}R,\]

where  is the [Ricci tensor](../Page/里奇曲率張量.md "wikilink"),  is the
[metric tensor](../Page/度量张量.md "wikilink") and  is the [scalar
curvature](../Page/数量曲率.md "wikilink"). It is used in the [Einstein
field equations](../Page/爱因斯坦场方程.md "wikilink").

## 應力-能量張量

[StressEnergyTensor_contravariant.svg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:StressEnergyTensor_contravariant.svg "fig:StressEnergyTensor_contravariant.svg")

The **stress–energy tensor** (sometimes **stress–energy–momentum
tensor** or **energy–momentum tensor**) is a
[tensor](../Page/張量.md "wikilink") quantity in
[physics](../Page/物理学.md "wikilink") that describes the
[density](../Page/密度.md "wikilink") and
[flux](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/通量 "wikilink") of
[energy](../Page/能量.md "wikilink") and
[momentum](../Page/动量.md "wikilink") in
[spacetime](../Page/时空.md "wikilink"), generalizing the [stress
tensor](../Page/應力.md "wikilink") of Newtonian physics. It is an
attribute of [matter](../Page/物质.md "wikilink"),
[radiation](../Page/辐射.md "wikilink"), and non-gravitational s. The
stress–energy tensor is the source of the [gravitational
field](../Page/引力場.md "wikilink") in the [Einstein field
equations](../Page/爱因斯坦场方程.md "wikilink") of [general
relativity](../Page/廣義相對論.md "wikilink"), just as mass density is the
source of such a field in [Newtonian
gravity](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/牛顿万有引力定律 "wikilink").

## 愛因斯坦方程

The **Einstein field equations** (**EFE**) or **Einstein's equations**
are a set of 10 [equations](../Page/方程.md "wikilink") in [Albert
Einstein's](../Page/阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦.md "wikilink") [general theory of
relativity](../Page/廣義相對論.md "wikilink") which describe the [fundamental
interaction](../Page/基本相互作用.md "wikilink") of
[gravitation](../Page/引力.md "wikilink") as a result of
[spacetime](../Page/时空.md "wikilink") being
[curved](../Page/曲率.md "wikilink") by
[matter](../Page/物质.md "wikilink") and
[energy](../Page/能量.md "wikilink").\[6\] First published by Einstein
in 1915\[7\] as a [tensor equation](../Page/張量.md "wikilink"), the EFE
equate local spacetime [curvature](../Page/曲率.md "wikilink") (expressed
by the [Einstein
tensor](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/爱因斯坦张量 "wikilink"))
with the local energy and [momentum](../Page/动量.md "wikilink") within
that spacetime (expressed by the [stress–energy
tensor](../Page/應力-能量張量.md "wikilink")).\[8\]

The Einstein Field Equations can be written as

\[G_{\mu \nu}= {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu} ,\]

where  is the [Einstein
tensor](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/爱因斯坦张量 "wikilink") and
 is the [stress–energy tensor](../Page/應力-能量張量.md "wikilink").

This implies that the curvature of space (represented by the Einstein
tensor) is directly connected to the presence of matter and energy
(represented by the stress–energy tensor).

## 史瓦西解與黑洞

In [Einstein](../Page/阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦.md "wikilink")'s theory of [general
relativity](../Page/廣義相對論.md "wikilink"), the **Schwarzschild metric**
(also **Schwarzschild vacuum** or **Schwarzschild solution**), is a
solution to the [Einstein field
equations](../Page/爱因斯坦场方程.md "wikilink") which describes
the [gravitational field](../Page/引力場.md "wikilink") outside a spherical
mass, on the assumption that the [electric
charge](../Page/電荷.md "wikilink") of the mass, the [angular
momentum](../Page/角动量.md "wikilink") of the mass, and the universal
[cosmological constant](../Page/宇宙學常數.md "wikilink") are all zero. The
solution is a useful approximation for describing slowly rotating
astronomical objects such as many
[stars](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/恒星 "wikilink") and
[planets](../Page/行星.md "wikilink"), including Earth and the Sun. The
solution is named after [Karl
Schwarzschild](../Page/卡爾·史瓦西.md "wikilink"), who first
published the solution in 1916.

According to , the Schwarzschild metric is the most general ,  of the
[Einstein field equations](../Page/爱因斯坦场方程.md "wikilink"). A
**Schwarzschild black hole** or **static black hole** is a [black
hole](../Page/黑洞.md "wikilink") that has no
[charge](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/荷_\(物理\) "wikilink") or [angular
momentum](../Page/角动量.md "wikilink"). A Schwarzschild black hole is
described by the Schwarzschild metric, and cannot be distinguished from
any other Schwarzschild black hole except by its mass.

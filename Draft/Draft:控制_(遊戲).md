***Control*** is an upcoming [action-adventure](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game "wikilink") [video game](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/video_game "wikilink") developed by [Remedy Entertainment](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remedy_Entertainment "wikilink") and published by [505 Games](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/505_Games "wikilink"). The game revolves around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a secret U.S. government agency tasked with containing and studying phenomena which violate the laws of reality. As Jesse Faden, the Bureau's new Director, players explore the Oldest House – the FBC's paranormal [New York](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "wikilink") headquarters – and utilize powerful abilities in order to defeat a deadly enemy known only as the Hiss, which has invaded and corrupted reality. *Control* is set to be released on August 27, 2019 for [Microsoft Windows](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "wikilink"), [PlayStation 4](../Page/PlayStation_4.md "wikilink"), and [Xbox One](../Page/Xbox_One.md "wikilink").\[1\]

## Gameplay

Like Remedy's previous projects, *Control* is played from a [third-person perspective](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/third-person_perspective "wikilink"), and is built using Remedy's proprietary Northlight Engine, which was first used on the company's previous title *[Quantum Break](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Break "wikilink")*. As Jesse Faden, players wield the Service Weapon, a supernatural firearm that can be adapted into a variety of different forms with different combat applications.\[2\] In addition to the Service Weapon, Jesse also possesses a variety of supernatural abilities, including telekinesis, levitation, and the ability to control certain enemies. The Service Weapon and Jesse's abilities both expend Jesse's energy, necessitating a balance in their usage. The Service Weapon can be upgraded throughout the game via a skill tree; in order to gain new powers, players must locate various Objects of Power - ordinary items acted upon by supernatural forces - hidden throughout the Oldest House. Due to the versatility of the game's loadouts, *Control*'s combat system can be customized and balanced to each player's personal preferences.\[3\] Health in *Control* does not recharge automatically, and must be picked up from fallen enemies.\[4\]

*Control* is set within the Oldest House, a featureless [Brutalist](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture "wikilink") skyscraper in [New York City](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "wikilink"), which is referred to in-game as a "Place of Power." The Oldest House's interior is far larger than its exterior, an enormous, constantly shifting supernatural realm that defies the laws of [spacetime](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/spacetime "wikilink").\[5\] *Control* is built in the [Metroidvania](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania "wikilink") format, with a large world map that can be explored at a nonlinear pace, unlike Remedy's previous titles, which were primarily linear. As the player unlocks new abilities and clearance throughout the game, new areas of the Oldest House can be explored, opening various side-quests. Certain areas known as Control Points can be used to fast travel throughout the building after they have been cleared of enemies. A new A.I. system known as the Encounter Director controls interactions with enemies based on the player's level and location in the Oldest House.\[6\] Enemies in *Control* are predominantly human agents of the FBC possessed by the Hiss, an otherworldly force. They range from standard humans carrying firearms to heavily mutated variations which possess a variety of superpowers. Some of Jesse's abilities allow her to seize control of enemies' minds temporarily, turning them into her allies, and allowing their abilities to be used for the player's benefit.\[7\]

## Synopsis

### Setting

*Control* revolves around a clandestine [United States](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "wikilink") government agency known as the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC). The FBC's goal is to contain, study, and ultimately control objects and phenomena which defy [scientific law](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientific_law "wikilink"). To that end, they seek out paranormal phenomena on a national scale, including "Altered Items", ordinary objects acted upon by otherworldly forces, and "Altered World Events," or AWEs. Certain Altered Items known as Objects of Power cause AWEs, and can be used in-game to gain new abilities. The FBC contains Altered Items within the Oldest House, a featureless [Brutalist](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture "wikilink") skyscraper in [Manhattan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan "wikilink") that acts as the agency's headquarters. The Oldest House itself is considered a "Place of Power," and is vastly larger on the inside than on the outside, breaking the laws of reality. The Oldest House is connected to alternate dimensions which are studied by the FBC. Otherworldly forces leak into the Oldest House, including the Hiss, an unidentified force which acts as *Control*'s main antagonist. During the events of the game, the Hiss invades the Oldest House and the FBC, and Jesse Faden is tasked with regaining control of the supernatural building and restoring order to the Bureau.

### Plot

Jesse Faden arrives at the Federal Bureau of Control in search of her younger brother, Dylan, who was kidnapped by the Bureau in their childhood after a supernatural event occurred in their hometown of Ordinary. Arriving at the Oldest House, the FBC's supernatural headquarters, Jesse finds it under attack by a hostile force known only as "the Hiss," which possesses the FBC's agents and corrupts the building. After Zachariah Trench, the Bureau's Director, is killed mysteriously, Jesse is unexpectedly deemed to be the new Director after she is chosen to wield the Service Weapon, a supernatural Object of Power which determines the Bureau's leadership. Wielding a host of supernatural powers, Jesse is tasked with defeating the Hiss and restoring order to the Oldest House. Along the way, she locates the scattered surviving agents of the FBC, including Research Specialist Emily Pope, Security Chief Simon Arish, Head of Research Casper Darling, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, and Head of Security Salvador.

## Development

The game is being developed by [Remedy Entertainment](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remedy_Entertainment "wikilink"). Mikael Kasurinen, who has worked on Remedy's previous project, *[Quantum Break](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Break "wikilink")*, is the game's director and [Sam Lake](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Lake "wikilink") served as the game's writer and creative director.\[8\]\[9\] Development of the game began before the release of *Quantum Break*.\[10\] Previous Remedy games, including *[Quantum Break](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Break "wikilink")*, made references to some of *Control*{{'}}s story elements, including Altered World Events. Instead of focusing on creating a large and complex story, the game's writers put more emphasis on creating a game world and universe that is rich enough for players to craft their own stories.\[11\] Another goal for the team was to create a game that has high replayability.\[12\] Lake assured players that the game will nonetheless feature a strong narrative, one that is "narrowly focused" according to Kasurinen.\[13\]

In May 2017, Remedy announced that they had partnered with [505 Games](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/505_Games "wikilink") to publish the game, then codenamed "P7". 505 provided marketing and publishing support and a fund of €7.75 million to assist the game's development, while Remedy retained the [intellectual property](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/intellectual_property "wikilink") rights to *Control*. In the press release, Remedy revealed that the game will have complex gameplay mechanics and that it will be a "longer term experience" than its previous games.\[14\] *P7* was being worked on by Remedy alongside two other projects.\[15\] The game was officially revealed at [Sony Interactive Entertainment](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment "wikilink")'s [E3 2018](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3_2018 "wikilink") press conference.\[16\] It will be Remedy's first game on a Sony platform since 2003's *[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne_2:_The_Fall_of_Max_Payne "wikilink")*.\[17\] The game's main cast was announced at [New York Comic Con](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Comic_Con "wikilink") in 2018, consisting of various stars from Remedy's previous games. Courtney Hope, who played the character Beth Wilder in *[Quantum Break](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Break "wikilink")*, stars as Jesse Faden, while [James McCaffrey](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McCaffrey_\(actor\) "wikilink"), known for his roles as the titular character of *[Max Payne](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne "wikilink")* and Thomas Zane in *[Alan Wake](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake "wikilink")*, plays the role of Zachariah Trench. [Matthew Porretta](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Porretta "wikilink"), famous for his role as the titular character of *[Alan Wake](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake "wikilink")*, is also featured as the character of Dr. Casper Darling.\[18\]

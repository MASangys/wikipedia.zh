维克托 H. 克鲁拉克 （1913.1.7——2008.12.29）是一位参与第二次世界大战、朝鲜战争和越战的美国海军陆战队军官，获得过许多荣誉。克鲁拉克被属下看作一位远见卓识者。他著有*First to Fight: An Inside View of the U.S. Marine Corps.* 他是第三十一任美国海军陆战队司令长官Charles C. Krulak的父亲。

## 个人生活

克鲁拉克出生在科罗拉多州的丹佛的犹太人家庭。父亲是Morris Krulak，母亲是Bessie (Zall) 。他后来否认自己的犹太血统，宣称自己由美国圣公会资助。他在1936年与Amy Chandler结婚直到2004年去世。夫妻两人总共育有三个孩子。

## 海军陆战队生涯

1934年5月31日，克鲁拉克从美国海军学院毕业后被授予少尉军衔。His early Marine Corps service included: sea duty aboard [USS *Arizona*](../Page/亞利桑那號戰艦.md "wikilink"), an assignment at the U.S. Naval Academy; duty with the 6th Marines in [San Diego](../Page/聖地牙哥_\(加利福尼亞州\).md "wikilink") and the 4th Marines in China (1937–39); completion of the Junior School, Quantico, Virginia (1940); and an assignment with the 1st Marine Brigade, FMF, later the [1st Marine Division](../Page/美國海軍陸戰隊第1師.md "wikilink").

While stationed as an observer in Shanghai during the [Second Sino-Japanese War](../Page/中国抗日战争.md "wikilink") in 1937, Krulak took photographs with a telephoto lens of a ramp-bowed landing boat that the Japanese had been using. Recognizing the potential use of such a craft by the U.S. armed forces, Krulak sent details and photographs back to Washington, but discovered years later that they had been filed away as having come from "some nut out in China". Krulak built a model of the Japanese boat design and discussed the retractable ramp approach with boat builder Andrew Higgins who incorporated elements of Krulak's input into the Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel (LCVP) or "Higgins boat", which played critical roles in the Normandy Landings and amphibious assaults in the Pacific.\[1\]

At the outbreak of [World War II](../Page/第二次世界大战.md "wikilink"), Krulak was a captain serving as [aide](../Page/侍從官.md "wikilink") to General [Holland M. Smith](../Page/霍蘭·史密斯.md "wikilink"), the Commanding General, Amphibious Corps, Atlantic Fleet. He volunteered for parachute training and on completion of training, he was ordered to the Pacific area as commander of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, 1st Marine Amphibious Corps. He went into action at [Vella Lavella](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/維拉拉維拉島 "wikilink") with the 2nd New Zealand Brigade.

As a lieutenant colonel in the fall of 1943, he earned the [Navy Cross](../Page/海軍十字勳章.md "wikilink") and the [Purple Heart](../Page/紫心勋章.md "wikilink") on Choiseul Island, where his battalion staged a week-long diversionary raid to cover the [Bougainville](../Page/布干維爾島戰役.md "wikilink") invasion.\[2\] Later, he joined the newly formed 6th Marine Division and took part in the [Okinawa campaign](../Page/沖繩島戰役.md "wikilink") and the surrender of Japanese forces in the China area, earning the Legion of Merit with "V" device for valor and the [Bronze Star](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/銅星勳章 "wikilink").The navy [PT boat](../Page/PT艇.md "wikilink"), PT-59, captained by [John F. Kennedy](../Page/约翰·肯尼迪.md "wikilink") helped evacuate Krulak's force from Choiseul at the end of the operation. In response, Krulak promised Kennedy a bottle of whiskey which he delivered almost 20 years later when Kennedy was serving as President of the United States.\[3\]

After the war, Krulak returned to the United States and served as Assistant Director of the Senior School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, and, later, as Regimental Commander of the 5th Marines at [Camp Pendleton](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/彭德顿营 "wikilink").

### Korean War

He was serving as Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, when the [Korean War](../Page/朝鲜战争.md "wikilink") erupted, and subsequently served in Korea as Chief of Staff, [1st Marine Division](../Page/美國海軍陸戰隊第1師.md "wikilink"), earning a second Legion of Merit with Combat "V" and Air Medal.

From 1951 to 1955, Krulak served at Headquarters Marine Corps as Secretary of the General Staff, then rejoined Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, as Chief of Staff.

### 1956 to 1959

In July 1956, he was promoted to brigadier general and designated assistant commander, 3rd Marine Division on [Okinawa](../Page/沖繩縣.md "wikilink"). From 1957 to 1959, he served as director, Marine Corps Educational Center, Quantico. He was promoted to major general in November 1959, and the following month assumed command of the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego.

### Vietnam War

[缩略图](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lt._Gen._Victor_Krulak_at_Camp_Pendleton_tactical_test_exercise.jpg "fig:缩略图") From 1962 to 1964, Krulak served as Special Assistant for Counter Insurgency Activities, Organization of the [Joint Chiefs of Staff](../Page/美國參謀長聯席會議.md "wikilink"); for which he was presented a third Legion of Merit for exceptional meritorious service by [General Maxwell D. Taylor](../Page/馬克斯維爾·泰勒.md "wikilink"), [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff](../Page/美國參謀長聯席會議主席.md "wikilink"). During this period, American military advisors were providing assistance to the South Vietnamese in their war against the Viet Cong. In September 1963, then Major General Krulak and Joseph Mendenhall, a senior Foreign Service officer, led a fact-finding mission to learn about the progress of the war. Krulak said that the situation was very good and supported President [Ngo Dinh Diem](../Page/吳廷琰.md "wikilink"), while Mendenhall claimed the opposite, leading Kennedy to famously ask the pair if they had visited the same country. In late December 1963, the new president, [Lyndon B. Johnson](../Page/林登·约翰逊.md "wikilink"), ordered an interdepartmental group to be headed by Krulak with the purpose of studying OPLAN 34A and selecting from it those targets the United States could hit in North Vietnam with the least amount of risk to its people. This was in keeping with the administration's policy of *graduated pressure* on the North Vietnamese.\[4\] [左](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Victor_H._Krulak_in_1965.jpg "fig:左") On March 1, 1964, Krulak was designated Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, and promoted to Lieutenant General. For the next four years, Krulak was responsible for all Fleet Marine Force units in the Pacific, including some 54 trips to the Vietnam theater. Many sources including Coram (2010) report that the Chu Lai base, which commenced in May 1965, was named after Krulak's own Chinese name.\[5\]

At the beginning of the [war](../Page/越南战争.md "wikilink"), Krulak put forward the "Spreading Inkblot Theory." This promoted a spreading inkblot of small units actions to pacify South Vietnam village by village. When large enemy units were encountered then General [Westmoreland's](../Page/威廉·威斯特摩兰.md "wikilink") overwhelming firepower should be employed. He also called for intensive bombing of [North Vietnam](../Page/越南民主共和国.md "wikilink") and mining of [Haiphong Harbor](../Page/海防市.md "wikilink"). Krulak's plans were eventually rejected as Westmoreland favored hammering the enemy into submission through superior firepower and the Johnson administration feared relentless bombing of the North would provoke [Soviet](../Page/苏联.md "wikilink") and Chinese intervention.\[6\] Krulak opposed the establishment of the Khe Sanh Combat Base.\[7\]

Krulak hoped to become the next [Commandant of the Marine Corps](../Page/美国海军陆战队司令.md "wikilink"), but in 1967 Lyndon B. Johnson selected Leonard F. Chapman, Jr.. As a result, Krulak retired on June 1, 1968, receiving a [Navy Distinguished Service Medal](../Page/海军杰出服役勋章.md "wikilink") for his performance during that period.\[8\] Military historian Robert Coram states that it was Krulak's comments to President Johnson criticizing the restraints placed on American military operations in Vietnam that resulted in Johnson's selection of Chapman over Krulak.\[9\] General Krulak's son Charles C. Krulak eventually became the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps, serving from 1995 to 1999.

## Strategic vehicle advocacy

Krulak was an early advocate of using [helicopters as attack platforms](../Page/攻击直升机.md "wikilink"). He was also instrumental in the development of Higgins boats, which enabled beach landings of men and material in World War II.\[10\]

## Post-military career

After retiring from the Marine Corps, Krulak worked for Copley Newspapers, including serving as president of Copley News Service and vice president of Copley Press. He retired from Copley in 1977, though he continued to contribute to their news service.\[11\] Krulak also wrote a number of books, including the iconic Marine Corps history *First to Fight*.\[12\]

In retirement, Krulak was active in community organizations, as well as participating in Marine Corps activities. He served as president and trustee of the [Zoological Society of San Diego](../Page/圣迭戈动物园.md "wikilink").\[13\] His wife, Amy, died in 2004.\[14\]

On December 29, 2008, Lieutenant General Krulak died at age 95 in San Diego, California.\[15\]\[16\] He was survived by his three sons – retired Marine Corps Commandant General Charles Krulak, Reverend Victor Krulak (Commander Navy Chaplain Corps), Reverend William Krulak (Colonel USMCR) — four grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.\[17\] Krulak's funeral was held on January 8, 2009, in the chapel at [MCAS Miramar](../Page/米拉马海军陆战队航空站.md "wikilink"), with burial at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery.\[18\]

## Honors

In 2004, Lieutenant General Krulak was the recipient of the U.S. Naval Academy's Distinguished Graduate award, which honors alumni who have "provided a lifetime of service to the nation or armed forces, have made significant and distinguished contributions to the nation via their public service and have demonstrated a strong interest in supporting the Navy or Marine Corps and the United States Naval Academy. These individuals are the embodiment of the Naval Academy’s mission to provide graduates who will be ready '…to assume the highest responsibilities of command, citizenship and government.'"\[19\]

In 2007, at the Marine Corps Association's first annual banquet, [Secretary of Defense](../Page/美国国防部长.md "wikilink") [Robert Gates](../Page/罗伯特·盖茨.md "wikilink") recounted the story of Krulak's time in China and his career:\[20\]  

His book *First to Fight* won the 1984 Samuel Eliot Morison Award for Naval Literature.\[21\]\[22\]

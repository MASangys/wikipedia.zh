## 歷史

[Ngungunhane_Gungunhana.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ngungunhane_Gungunhana.jpg "fig:Ngungunhane_Gungunhana.jpg"), the last dynastic emperor of the Gaza Empire\]\]

In the 1820s, during a period of severe drought, after the abolition of slavery caused the [牛車大遷徙](../Page/牛車大遷徙.md "wikilink"),  armies, Southern (Xhosa) and especially Northern Nguni (Zulu, Swazi, Shangani, Gaza, Matabele or Ndebele, and Ngoni) people who speak related [Bantu languages](../Page/班图语支.md "wikilink") and inhabit southeast Africa from [Cape Province](../Page/開普省.md "wikilink") to southern [Mozambique](../Page/莫桑比克.md "wikilink"), began to migrate to Mozambique from what is now [South Africa](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/南非 "wikilink"). One Nguni chief, [Nxaba](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nxaba "wikilink"), established a short-lived kingdom inland from , but in 1837 he was defeated by [Soshangane](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soshangane "wikilink"), a powerful Nguni rival. Eventually Soshangane established his capital in the highlands of the middle [薩韋河](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/薩韋河 "wikilink") in what is present day Zimbabwe. Soshangane named his empire "Gaza" after his grandfather.\[2\]

Soshangane died in 1856 and there was a bitter struggle for power between his sons  and . With help from the Portuguese, Mzila eventually gained power in 1861 and ruled until 1884. Soshangane's grandson, , took over the Gaza Empire from his father Mzila and moved the capital southward to [Manjakazi](../Page/曼雅卡澤.md "wikilink"), putting him in closer proximity with the Portuguese.\[3\]

With the prolonged drought, the rise of Gaza, the dominance of the [奴隸貿易](../Page/奴隸貿易.md "wikilink"), and the expansion of Portuguese control in the [赞比西河](../Page/赞比西河.md "wikilink") Valley, the once-mighty African chieftaincies of the Zambezi region declined. In their place, valley warlords established fortified strongholds at the confluence of the major rivers, where they raised private armies and raided for slaves in the interior. The most powerful of these warlords was , also known as Gouveia, a settler from [葡屬印度](../Page/葡屬印度.md "wikilink"), who by the middle of the 19th century controlled most of the southern Zambezi Valley and a huge swath of land to its south. North of the Zambezi, Islamic slave traders rose to power from their base in , and the [約奧族](../Page/約奧族.md "wikilink") chiefs of the north migrated south to the highlands along the [希雷河](../Page/希雷河.md "wikilink"), where they established their military power.\[4\]

## 族群

The  descend from  speakers ([史瓦濟人](../Page/史瓦濟人.md "wikilink"), [祖魯族](../Page/祖魯族.md "wikilink") and [科薩人](../Page/科薩人.md "wikilink")) and [聰加人](../Page/聰加人.md "wikilink") speakers (, , , [Vadzonga](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadzonga "wikilink") and ), many of whom Soshangane conquered and subjugated. Soshangane insisted that Nguni customs be adopted, and that the Tsonga learn the Zulu language. Young Tsonga men were assigned to the army as "[Mabulandlela](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabulandlela "wikilink")" (those who open the road). Soshangane also imposed [Shaka Zulu](../Page/恰卡.md "wikilink")'s military system of dominion and taught the people the Zulu ways of fighting.\[5\]

For centuries, the Nguni peoples are thought to have lived in scattered [父系制度](../Page/父系制度.md "wikilink") chiefdoms, cultivating cereal crops such as  and raising [cattle](../Page/家牛.md "wikilink"). The current geographic distribution of Nguni peoples largely reflects the turbulent political developments and population movements of the 19th century. In the 1820s the cattle-herding Zulu, led by their king Shaka, embarked on an aggressive campaign of conquest and expansion known as the . Shaka's large and well-armed armies conquered a number of neighboring peoples, and sent others fleeing. Some Nguni groups adopted the Zulu's methods of warfare and used them to subjugate the peoples in whose territory they ultimately settled.\[6\]

## 遭到入侵

The Gaza Kingdom comprised parts of what are now southeastern [辛巴威](../Page/辛巴威.md "wikilink"), as well as extending from the Sabi River down to the southern part of Mozambique, covering parts of the current provinces of [索法拉省](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/索法拉省 "wikilink"), [马尼卡省](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/马尼卡省 "wikilink"), [伊尼扬巴内省](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/伊尼扬巴内省 "wikilink"), [加扎省](../Page/加扎省.md "wikilink") and [马普托省](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/马普托省 "wikilink"), and neighbouring parts of South Africa.\[7\] Within the area encompassed by the Gaza Empire, Nguni armies invaded the north and established cattle-owning military states along the edges of the Mozambican highlands. Although not within the borders of modern-day Mozambique, these military states nonetheless served as effective bases for raids into Mozambique.\[8\]

Soshangane extended his control over the area between the [Komati](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komati_River "wikilink") ([科馬提河](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/科馬提河 "wikilink")) and the Zambezi rivers, incorporating the local Tsonga and Shona peoples into his Kingdom. The waves of armed groups disrupted both trade and day-to-day production throughout the area. Two groups, the Jere under  and the  (both later known as Nguni) under Soshangane, swept through Mozambique. Zwangendaba’s group continued north across the [赞比西河](../Page/赞比西河.md "wikilink"), settling to the west of contemporary Mozambique, but Soshangane’s group crossed the [林波波河](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/林波波河 "wikilink") into southern.\[9\]

Another army, under the command of [Dingane](../Page/丁岡.md "wikilink") and [Mhlangana](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mhlangana "wikilink"), was sent by Shaka to deal with Soshangane, but the army suffered great hardship because of hunger and [疟疾](../Page/疟疾.md "wikilink"), and Soshangane had no difficulty in driving them off, towards the end of 1828. During the whole of this turbulent period, from 1830 onwards, groups of Tsonga speakers moved southwards and defeated smaller groups.\[10\]

Despite their eviction from the highlands, the Portuguese gradually extended their control up the Zambezi Valley and north and south along the Mozambican coast. In 1727, they founded a trading post at [伊尼揚巴內](../Page/伊尼揚巴內.md "wikilink"), on the southern coast, and in 1781 they permanently occupied [馬普托灣](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/馬普托灣 "wikilink"). However, Soshangane’s army overran these Portuguese settlements during the time of the Gaza Empire.\[11\]

The empire under Soshangane has been criticized for involvement in the slave trade between the year 1830 and 1897, and human rights violations over the indigenous peoples of Mozambique and Zimbabwe.\[12\] The Shangaan tribe has recently also been accused of enforcing tribalism over the Tsonga people of South Africa.\[13\]

## Decline

After the death of [Soshangane](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soshangane "wikilink") in 1856, his sons fought over being his successor. He had left the throne to Mzila, but Mawewe felt that he should be emperor instead. Mawewe attacked Mzila and his followers, causing them to leave Mozambique and flee to the [索特潘斯山脈](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/索特潘斯山脈 "wikilink") Mountains in the [川斯瓦共和國](../Page/川斯瓦共和國.md "wikilink"). In 1884 and 1885 European powers carved Africa into [勢力範圍](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/勢力範圍 "wikilink") at the [柏林西非會議](../Page/柏林西非會議.md "wikilink"). As a result of this [瓜分非洲](../Page/瓜分非洲.md "wikilink") by the European States, the territory of the Gaza Empire was designated as Portuguese territory.\[14\]  fiercely resisted the encroachment of the Portuguese but was eventually defeated. Gungunyana was exiled to the [亚速尔群岛](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/亚速尔群岛 "wikilink") where he died in 1906. The cause of the collapse of the Gaza Empire was its defeat by the Portuguese in 1895.\[15\]

## Present day

The territories of the Gaza Empire are now ruled by Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Mozambique is divided into eleven provinces, one of which is named [加扎省](../Page/加扎省.md "wikilink").\[16\]

The descendants of Gungunyana currently reside in South Africa, including *de jure* king Eric Mpisane Nxumalo whose application for recognition by the Nhlapo Commission was rejected in 2012.\[17\] \[18\]Claims of the kingdom's authority over the [Tsonga people](../Page/聰加人.md "wikilink") of South Africa have also been rejected by Tsonga traditional leaders in South Africa.

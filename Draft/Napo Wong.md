**Napo Wong**

Napo Wong is a political figure in Hong Kong and the former Deputy Secretary-General of the [League of Social Democrats](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Social_Democrats "wikilink") (LSD), a political party in Hong Kong. Graduated from [St. Paul’s College](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul’s_College "wikilink") and the Department of Government and Public Administration of the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong "wikilink") (CUHK), Napo was the President of the CUHK Student Union and the Chairperson of the [Hong Kong Federation of Students](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Federation_of_Students "wikilink") Council, as well as a candidate in the 2010 [Hong Kong Legislative Council](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Legislative_Council "wikilink") (LegCo) By-election representing Tertiary 2012, a student group which he formed with other university students.

## Political career

Napo worked for an NGO from 2011 to 2013, advocating for social policy reform, including the campaign against the eligibility requirement for Old Age Living Allowance introduced in 2012 and the fight for universal pension scheme. In 2013, Napo was one of the activists in the [2013 Hong Kong dock strike](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Hong_Kong_dock_strike "wikilink") that demanded a wage hike for workers in the [Kwai Tsing Container Terminal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwai_Tsing_Container_Terminal "wikilink").

## Legislative assistant

In 2012, Napo was appointed as the legislative assistant of \[Leung Kwok-hung\], a Member of the LegCo then. Napo also joined the LSD as the Deputy Secretary-General.

After the \[Umbrella Movement\] in 2014, Napo teamed up with activist Lau Siu-lai who eventually was elected as a legislator in 2016 with Napo’s support. In the same year, Napo became Lau Siu-lai’s legislative assistant.

During the time as an assistant to both lawmakers, Napo was mainly responsible for policy analysis, aspiring to assist Leung Kwok-hung and Lau Siu-lai in defending justice in LegCo and safeguarding Hong Kong people's rights.

## Participation in social movements

Having been active in political movements since he was an undergraduate, Napo was the President of the CUHK Student Union and the Chairperson of the \[Hong Kong Federation of Students\] Council. He also co-founded Tertiary 2012 and took part in the 2010 LegCo By-election, dubbed the "Five District Referendum”. Napo's enthusiasm for democracy and justice is evident in all that he does.

During the demonstration against the provision of advance funding for the North East New Territories New Development Area, Napo was arrested, escorted to a darkened police car and assaulted by police officers inside. Subsequently, the Police allegedly demanded that Google delete the video which recorded the officers' violence towards the five activists arrested during the protest, including Napo and Jaco Chow Nok Hang, in the police car with curtains closed and the light turned off in a bid to hide the assault.

In 2017, elected LegCo Member Lau Siu-lai was forcefully disqualified from office. Napo, who was her assistant at the time, was also rejected from the Council as a consequence. Lau Siu-lai was again disqualified in 2018 as a candidate in the LegCo Kowloon West By-election. Napo switched to operate the election campaign of Lee Cheuk-yan, who was a backup candidate representing the pro-democracy camp in place of Lau Siu-lai. After completing the campaign in November of the same year, Napo took a few months break from social movement.

## Running for the District Council Election

The \[2019 Hong Kong protests\] has made Napo realise that he simply cannot detach from political movements. He must fulfill his desire and serve the cause.

Napo has been living in \[Sai Ying Pun\] for two decades. He knows well the damage arising from a District Council dominated by pro-government lackeys whose only meaning of existence is to invert right and wrong in the favour of those in power. Determined to speak for his own community and bring the real voices of residents into the District Council, Napo decided to run for the election, with a mission to monitor the Government's use of public money and implementation of policies, paving the road for community involvement in the fight for democracy in Hong Kong.

Napo believes that the people should be the master of their own District Council. In October 2019, Napo formally declared his candidacy and became the candidate of the A11 Sai Ying Pun constituency of the \[Central and Western District Council\] against Timothy Lau of the \[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong\].

## 歷史History

[Enamel_factory_2.JPG](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Enamel_factory_2.JPG "fig:Enamel_factory_2.JPG") The company was established by three 猶太人(Jewish) 企業家(entrepreneurs): Michal Gutman from 本津(Bedzin), Izrael Kahn from 克拉科夫(Kraków), and Wolf Luzer Glajtman from 奧爾庫什(Olkusz). The partners leased the production halls from the factory of wire, mesh, and iron products with its characteristic sawtooth roofs, and purchased a plot at ul. Lipowa 4 for their future base. It was then that the following were built: the stamping room where metal sheets were processed, prepared and pressed, the deacidification facility (varnishing) where the vessels were bathed in a solution of sulfuric acid to remove all impurities and grease, and the enamel shop, where enamel was laid in a number of layers: the priming coat first, then the colour, and finally another protective coat.

The ownership of the company changed a number of times, and its financial situation continued to worsen. In June 1939, the company applied for insolvency, which was officially announced by the Regional Court in Kraków.

### 第二次世界大戰World War II

On 1 September 1939, [Nazi Germany](../Page/納粹德國.md "wikilink") [invaded Poland](../Page/波蘭戰役.md "wikilink") and the [Second World War](../Page/第二次世界大战.md "wikilink") broke out. On 6 September, German troops entered Kraków. It was also probably around that time in which [Oskar Schindler](../Page/奧斯卡·辛德勒.md "wikilink"), a  who was a member of the [NSDAP](../Page/纳粹党.md "wikilink") and an agent of the [Abwehr](../Page/阿勃維爾.md "wikilink"), arrived in Kraków. Using the power of the German occupation forces in the capacity of a trustee, he took over the German kitchenware shop on ul. Krakowska, and in November 1939, on the power of the decision of the Trusteeship Authority he took over the receivership of the "Rekord" company in Zablocie. He also produced ammunition shells, so that his factory would be classed as an essential part of the war effort. He managed to build a subcamp of the [Płaszów forced labor camp](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/普瓦舒夫集中营 "wikilink") in the premises where "his" Jews had scarce contact with camp guards.

### Post-War

After the war, in the period 1948–2002, the factory was utilised by Krakowskie Zakłady Elektroniczne Unitra-Telpod (later renamed Telpod S.A.), a company manufacturing telecommunications equipment.\[2\]

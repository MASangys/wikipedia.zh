## Career

### Toolmaker and inventor

Babbitt is credited with inventing the first circular saw for use in a [鋸木廠](../Page/鋸木廠.md "wikilink")([saw mill)](../Page/鋸木廠.md "wikilink") in 1813. According to the Shakers, Babbitt was watching men use the difficult two-man  when she noticed that half of their motion was wasted.\[5\] She proposed creating a round blade to increase efficiency. The circular saw was connected to a water-powered machine to reduce the effort to cut lumber.\[6\]\[7\] The first circular saw she allegedly made is in[奥爾巴尼](../Page/奥尔巴尼.md "wikilink")([Albany)](../Page/奥尔巴尼.md "wikilink"), [紐約州(New York)](../Page/纽约州.md "wikilink").\[8\] In the summer of 1948, a version of Babbitt's saw, built to her specifications, was on display at a [震教徒(Shaker)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/震教徒 "wikilink") exhibit at [Fenimore House](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenimore_House "wikilink") in Cooperstown, N. Y., as a loan from the .\[9\]

Babbitt is also credited with inventing a process for the manufacture of false teeth and an improved spinning wheel head.\[10\] She also allegedly invented [釘子](../Page/钉子.md "wikilink")([cut nails](../Page/钉子.md "wikilink")), although the Shakers also credit the invention to the non-Shaker, [Eli Whitney](../Page/伊莱·惠特尼.md "wikilink").\[11\] As a Shaker, Babbitt never [patented](../Page/专利.md "wikilink") any of her inventions.

## Controversy over circular saw invention

Because Babbitt did not patent her circular saw and the reference to her invention exists only in Shaker lore, there is controversy over whether she was the true first inventor of the saw. According to some accounts, two French men patented the circular saw in the United States by two French men after reading about Babbitt's saw in Shaker papers.\[12\] M. Stephen Miller argues that Babbitt was not the first inventor of the circular saw, based upon the date that she joined the sect. He contends that the circular saw was invented at  by Amos Bishop or Benjamin Bruce in 1793\[13\] —or not by a Shaker at all.\[14\]

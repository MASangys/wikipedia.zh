'Youth employment with generational inequality in Australia' is a reflective term that shows the young generation's struggle in employment within the new economy. Precarious work as a new formation of employment changed people's participation experience during working, leads to a different form of social inequality that defines the young generation into classes. Youth employment status from the lower class shows the reformation of social inequality, in which the young generations' definition of inequality has renewed from lack of economic gain to critical shortage in social capital. That is, inequality between classes is dynamic in the sense that the privilege in prestige is outweighing original advantage on economic capital, sociological capitals like professional certificate, personal relationship, and educational honor become the main distinguisher between youth among classes in last few decades, and thus create a new pattern of social inequality.

For example, in August 1966, 80% of men aged over 15 were employed full time, by August 2011, this proportion had fallen to 57%. Declining participation of workers in the male group, especially young age group, shows individualization process, which caused a generational change in the preference of life pattern and environmental recognition for young people.\[1\] (Australian Bureau of statistics, 2011)

Such changes are dynamic and universal, which contain timeline narratives that continuing through generations. In particular, education, relationship and transitions to adulthood are three main components that create social inequality, distinguish the young generation into levels of social hierarchy. These components are illustrated in everyday life choice made by young Australian and observed by SVA (Social Ventures Australia) to create principle of youth employment.\[2\] (Crabb, 2015)The picture include several principles that symbolize individual development or community infrastructural building, both are results of individualization process that create new forms of internal and external demand for young Australian to adopt in modern economy. Combining individualization and fashion theory of Simmel (1997)\[3\], the growing personal freedom allow young Australian from lower class to operate distinctively, but also raise the barrier among young people in labor market more often, which emerge social inequality in new economy formation.


\== Education ==

In 2009, 83.2% of Australian graduates of bachelor degree have achieved full-time or part-time employment with contract bound occupation. However, this securitized number decreased to 67% in 2017.\[4\] Data reveals that higher education certificate are less valuable in sense that it becomes more ordinary and common. The public recognition to Bachelor degree is undermining its functional importance when young people entering labor market, thus creating a more competitive environment in education period, and better possession of educational capital has greater impact to entrance of employment. (McDonald, P., Price, P., & Bailey, J, 2013)\[5\] Meanwhile, their time management are different from elder generation who consider Bachlor or even year 12 as the end of education. That is, argued by B. Pocock, N. Skinner & P. Williams (2012),\[6\] to better adjust self into competition, young Australian are forced by market rules to develop own educational resources, obtain better professional skills require longer period of time in education but reduce youth's employment hours.

## Relationship

Except mass data, autographical interviews also illustrate the role individualism played in categorizing youth into different social classess. The nature of precarious work is changing from simple commercial benefit to the agenda building for youth individual. The purpose of work is more than just economic gain, but also finding connection with other social units to obtain social capitals. According to Vallas, S. (2019)\[7\] youths from lllawarra region often selectively shape their particular circumstances and construct connection with social units that they believe could provide them great working experience and social agenda. In relations to principles of employment, building business partnership, alternative employment pathways and personalised support all embody the apperance of relational network in youth employment.

## Transition to adulthood

The less focus on economic gain is an expression with reprefentative performance to show young people's changing recognition of term 'adulthood'. During their early education, youth grow ideology that prefer flexibility and mobility, different from their elder generation who consider economic security as priority. As a result, their behavior guideline was build upon principle of picture, which mostly embody individualism.\[8\] One visable feature of such trend is the increasing youth adult living in parential home, refering to 15-29 year olds who are living with one or both parents and who are themselves neither a parent nor a partner in a couple relationship.From 1986-1999, with 20-24 year olds and 25-29 year olds accounting for about half each of the overall increase in the number of young adults living at home. The proportion of 20-24 year olds living at home increased from 42% in 1986 to 47% in 1999. During the same period, the proportion of 25-29 year olds living at home increased from 12% to 17%. (Australian Bureau of statistics, 2000)\[9\] It proves economic dependece to elder generation as the replacement solution when youth measure their time in other subjects, for instence, education and relational network building. The shift of value system again reflecting individualization in terms of generational change, where inequality are reproduced during youth's pursuasion of social capitals. In order to continue educational gruaduation build relational network and, independence is delayed with rational or emotional calculation to achieve whether self-development or self-representation.

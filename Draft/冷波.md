**冷波**（英語：**Chillwave**），又譯作**冷浪**，是一種出現在[2000年代](../Page/2000年代.md "wikilink")後期的音樂。這類音樂的特色在於輕柔或夢幻的樂音、虛幻的歌詞（歌詞常會圍繞著夏日及海灘）、或（又稱低傳真音樂）的審美觀、柔和的人聲、低至中速的節奏、[效果聲](../Page/效果器.md "wikilink")（其中[殘響尤其常用](../Page/混響.md "wikilink")），以及復古的[合成器](../Page/合成器.md "wikilink")聲。「冷波」原先是與及同義的。

冷波大致上模仿著1980年代的[電子流行](../Page/電子流行.md "wikilink")樂，且散發著[懷舊](../Page/懷舊.md "wikilink")以及[記憶](../Page/記憶.md "wikilink")中的情調。它是第一批透過[網際網路所誕生的音樂類型之一](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/網際網路 "wikilink")。「冷波」這個名詞最早於2009年在有著諷刺風格的部落格「Hipster Runoff 」中被發明，用以形容那些創作的音樂聽來像是1980年代[家用錄影系統磁帶中的](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/家用錄影系統 "wikilink")的獨立音樂創作者。這類音樂的創作者中最突出的當屬樂團、以及等人，他們都於「冷波之夏」中受到了許多矚目。Washed Out於2009年發表的曲子「」更被認為是史上最有名的冷波歌曲。

The term was criticized for being nebulous and contrived by various media publications, while the music was often derided for its reliance on nostalgia. Some artists rejected the tag, while many exploited the style's low-budget simplicity, which led to an oversaturation of acts. Another Internet-based microgenre, [vaporwave](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Vaporwave "wikilink"), evolved from chillwave.



## Etymology

[链接=<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Neon_Indian_performing_at_Bestival_2010.jpg>](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Neon_Indian_performing_at_Bestival_2010.jpg "fig:链接=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Neon_Indian_performing_at_Bestival_2010.jpg") performing in 2010\]\] Most accounts attribute "chillwave" to a July 2009 post written by "Carles", the anonymous manager of the blog Hipster Runoff. The site, which was active between 2008 and 2013, was known for its ironic posts on "alt" trends.\[1\] Carles used the term to describe a host of similar rising bands. A July 27 post titled "Is [WASHED OUT](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Washed_Out "wikilink") the next [Neon Indian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Neon_Indian "wikilink")/[Memory Cassette](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Memory_Cassette "wikilink")?" ruminated on a nascent trend involving the "musicsphere" searching for a "new 'authentic, undergroundish product' that isn't a huge brand like [AnCo](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Animal_Collective "wikilink")/[GrizzBear](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Grizzly_Bear_\(band\) "wikilink")/etc. ... It seems easiest to have a chill project, that is somewhat 'conceptual' but also demonstrates that ur band has 'pop sensibilities' or something." He proposed a list of genre names, including "Chill Bro Core", "post-AnCo rock", "Conceptual Blog Core", and "post-electro". The post concludes:Carles later explained that he was "\[throwing\] a bunch of pretty silly names on a blog post and saw which one stuck."\[2\] Neon Indian's Alan Palomo surmised that the name stuck "because it was the most dismissive and sarcastic ... the term chillwave came when the era of blog-mediated music was at its height at that time."\[3\] The term did not gain mainstream currency until early 2010, when it was the subject of articles by *[The Wall Street Journal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:The_Wall_Street_Journal "wikilink")* and *[The New York Times](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:The_New_York_Times "wikilink")*. \[4\]

Chillwave was one of the first genres to acquire an identity online.\[5\] According to writer Garin Pirnia, it is an example of linking musical trends by Internet outlets rather than geographic location. Pirnia wrote in 2010 (quoting Palomo), "Whereas musical movements were once determined by a city or venue where the bands congregated, 'now it's just a blogger or some journalist that can find three or four random bands around the country and tie together a few commonalities between them and call it a genre.'"

## Style and milieu

### Precursors

Chillwave has been classified as [psychedelia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Psychedelic_music "wikilink"), [bedroom pop](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Bedroom_pop "wikilink"), or [electropop](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Electropop "wikilink").\[6\] Before the term was invented, chillwave music was described as [shoegaze](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Shoegaze "wikilink"), [dream pop](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Dream_pop "wikilink"),\[7\] [ambient](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Ambient_music "wikilink"), or [indietronica](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Indietronica "wikilink"). *[Pitchfork](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Pitchfork_\(website\) "wikilink")*{{'}}s Nitsuh Abebe writes that, since at least 1992, the style has existed for the same principal reason: "stoned, happy college kids listening to records while they fall asleep." Abebe cites [Slowdive](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Slowdive "wikilink"), [Darla Records](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Darla_Records "wikilink")' *Blissed Out* ambient compilations, and [Casino Versus Japan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Casino_Versus_Japan "wikilink")'s eponymous 1998 album as examples. One of the earliest known manifestations of the genre is [the Beach Boys](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:The_Beach_Boys "wikilink")' song "[All I Wanna Do](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:All_I_Wanna_Do_\(Beach_Boys_song\) "wikilink")" from their 1970 album *[Sunflower](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Sunflower_\(Beach_Boys_album\) "wikilink")*.\[8\]\[9\] [Boards of Canada](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Boards_of_Canada "wikilink"), whom Abebe says pre-chillwave music was often compared to, were also influential.\[10\] [链接=<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ariel_pink_(3439870529).jpg>](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ariel_pink_\(3439870529\).jpg "fig:链接=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ariel_pink_(3439870529).jpg") performing in 2009\]\] [Ariel Pink](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Ariel_Pink "wikilink") is frequently described as "the godfather of chillwave".\[11\] He gained recognition in the mid 2000s through a string of self-produced albums, inventing a sound that critic [Simon Reynolds](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Simon_Reynolds "wikilink") called "'70s radio-rock and '80s new wave as if heard through a defective transistor radio, glimmers of melody flickering in and out of the fog".\[12\] The [Paw Tracks](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Paw_Tracks "wikilink") record label, which distributed Pink's albums, was run by [Animal Collective](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Animal_Collective "wikilink"), who signed Pink after being impressed by a CD of his home recordings, starting with *[The Doldrums](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:The_Doldrums_\(album\) "wikilink")* (2000).\[13\] In 2010, *[Uncut](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Uncut_\(magazine\) "wikilink")*{{'}}s Sam Richard profiled Pink as "a lo-fi legend" whose "ghostly pop sound" proved influential to chillwave acts such as [Ducktails](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Ducktails_\(band\) "wikilink") and Toro y Moi.\[14\] Discussing chillwave's bedroom pop precursors, Allene Norton of Cellars believes that Pink is "definitely not chillwave but that kind of stuff influenced a lot of the artists making it, like Washed Out."\[15\] *[Dummy Mag](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Dummy_Mag "wikilink")*{{'}}s Adam Harper disputed Pink's "godfather of chillwave" status, writing that his influence on lo-fi scenes has been somewhat overstated:, and that his music lacks "the mirror-shades-cool synth groove of chillwave ... Pink's albums are zany, personal, largely rock-based and dressed in awkward glam".\[16\]The genre's flourishing between 2008 and 2009\[17\] was prefigured by the 2007 album *[Person Pitch](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Person_Pitch "wikilink")* by Animal Collective's [Noah Lennox](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Panda_Bear_\(musician\) "wikilink"), which is credited with launching the style.\[18\]\[19\]\[20\] The album influenced a wide range of subsequent [indie music](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Indie_music "wikilink"),\[21\] with its sound serving as the major inspiration for chillwave and a number of soundalikes.\[22\] Animal Collective's music also contributed to the movement.\[23\] Their album *[Merriweather Post Pavilion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:en:Merriweather_Post_Pavilion_\(album\) "wikilink")*, released in January 2009, was particularly influential for its ambient sounds and repetitive melodies, but was not as tightly associated with the "hazy" psychedelia that chillwave would be identified with.\[24\] According to *Flavorwire*{{'}}s Tom Hawking, chillwave acts extrapolated "the sort of ill-defined pastoral nostalgia" from Animal Collective's early work "and spun it into an entire genre." However, "Animal Collective were never really part of that scene, such as it was — they were more like its spiritual overlords".\[25\]

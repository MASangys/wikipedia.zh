 **剝脫性骨軟骨炎**（ 普遍縮寫為**OCD**或**OD**）是一種和下層的[軟骨下骨中形成碎裂的](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/骨骺 "wikilink")[關節疾病](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/關節 "wikilink")\[1\]。剝脫性骨軟骨炎會造成受損關節的疼痛和腫脹，進而造成運動上的障礙。[理學檢查](../Page/理學檢查.md "wikilink")一般可以看到關節、壓痛，以及。

此病況乃肇因於軟骨下骨區血液供應不足，導致軟骨下骨發生。死亡的硬骨會被人體再吸收，造成覆蓋在表面的關節軟骨受損、退化。受損的軟骨和硬骨會剝離，懸浮於關節腔中，引發疼痛或造成更嚴重的損傷\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]。由於本病況所造成的症狀與多種疾病類似，可能導致診斷不易，可以透過、[電腦斷層](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/X射线计算机断层成像 "wikilink")（CT），或[核磁共振](../Page/核磁共振成像.md "wikilink")（MRI）等影像學技術來輔助診斷。

目前保守療法（非外科治療）對關節的癒合效果有限，因此中度嚴重的患者即會建議進行外科手術治療。相關的保守療法包含減低關節負重及減少活動度等等。外科治療則包含使用關節鏡對未進犯的區域進行鑽孔，並以其他處的軟骨進行移植，另外還有及關節置換。術後復健分為兩階段，第一階段是姿勢固定，第二階段則是[物理治療](../Page/物理治療.md "wikilink")。復健的目標是在保護關節避免進一步受損的前提下，促進肌力及加強關節活動度。在姿勢固定階段，直腿伸起等，次類訓練可以減少肌肉流失，且又不會對軟骨造成更進一步的傷害。當姿勢固定期結束之後，即可引入連續性被動運動（continuous passive motion）及游泳和走路等低衝擊運動。

成人罹患剝脫性骨軟骨炎的發生率約在每年每十萬人2-4人之間\[5\]，兒童及青少年則約每十萬人9.5人\[6\]。雖然相對罕見，但在卻是造成[青少年](../Page/青少年.md "wikilink")運動性關節痛的重要原因\[7\]。但因為青少年的骨骼仍在發育，骨骼重塑能力較成人好，因此相比成年人更容易復原。剝脫性骨軟骨炎可能進犯所有關節，但最常見的進犯位置為膝關節，約佔所有主訴的75%。1887年，首度引入此一名詞，描述[軟骨表面發炎的現象](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/軟骨 "wikilink")。有多種疾病曾一度被誤認為是剝脫性骨軟骨炎，包含骨軟骨骨折（osteochondral fracture）、、附屬骨化中心（accessory ossification center）、遺傳性骨骺發育不良（hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia）、等等。動物也會患有剝脫性骨軟骨炎，特別是[馬](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/馬 "wikilink")\[8\]；某些[品種](../Page/品種.md "wikilink")的馬匹可能具有OCD相關基因，強迫發育的餵食和篩選出高壯體型的人為育種也是因素之一。剝脫性骨軟骨炎也常見於狗——尤其[德國牧羊犬](../Page/德國牧羊犬.md "wikilink")\[9\]，是中大型犬種肘關節發育不良的主因\[10\]。

對人類而言，剝脫性骨軟骨炎是一種[罕見疾病](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/罕見疾病 "wikilink")，每年總母體群平均每10萬人中只有15到30人會發病\[11\]。雖然罕見，它卻是[青少年](../Page/青少年.md "wikilink")運動性關節傷害的主要病因之一。\[12\]。膝關節是最常罹患剝脫性骨軟骨炎的關節部位，約佔75%的病例。根據[哈科特港大學研究](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/哈科特港大學 "wikilink")，由於當地飲用及灌溉水源受到化學汙染，剝脫性骨軟骨炎病況在[奈及利亞](../Page/奈及利亞.md "wikilink")農村地區有漸增的趨勢，尤其好發於婦女群體\[13\]。

## 症狀

此疾病屬於，初始的病灶原發於軟骨之中，之後受損的軟骨會從關節上鬆脫，進而引起疼痛和[發炎](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/發炎 "wikilink")，這些軟骨碎片則被稱為關節內游動體（joint mice）\[14\]。本病最常進犯膝關節，另也可能進犯踝關節和肘關節\[15\]。

患者一開始會以運動相關疼痛表現，常見主訴包含疼痛、關節腫，運動時可能感覺卡卡的（locking）、絆住感（catching）、產生彈響（popping noises），或軟腳（buckling）。有時會以關節活動度縮小作為初始表現\[16\]。第一期症狀通常在幾周內即會出現，第二期症狀大約會於一個月內出現，但若在此時未即時診斷出來，則病程會急遽惡化，病灶會從穩定的囊腫或裂縫，快速發展為不穩定的碎片。此時會出現類似和的一些[非特異性症狀](../Page/症狀.md "wikilink")，常延誤診斷\[17\]。

理學檢查一般可以發現關節積液、疼痛，和。疼痛一開始會大面積的出現，但之後會逐漸縮小到一個特定的局部位置。剝脫性骨軟骨炎的症狀與許多常見疾病相同，例如急性骨軟骨骨折（acute osteochondral fracture）同樣也會造成關節壓痛，但急性骨軟骨骨折通常較容易脂肪性。剝脫性骨軟骨炎不會造成特別的病理性步態，但患者可能會刻意將小腿外旋，避免脛骨棘（tibial spine）遭到外側面夾擊（impingement）\[18\]。

## 病因

剝脫性骨軟骨關節炎的成因迄今未明，相關的假說包含[物理性因素](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/創傷 "wikilink")、[基因遺傳](../Page/遺傳.md "wikilink")、[血液供應不足](../Page/缺血.md "wikilink")，以及股骨遠端骨骺板異常骨化等等\[19\]。雖然本疾病被稱為「骨軟骨關節炎」，但組織學上缺乏發炎細胞參與，屬於一種非發炎性疾病。目前認為骨關節反覆性的會導致硬骨的輕微磨損，進而影響軟骨下硬骨的血流供應，導致硬骨缺血或生長異常\[20\]。

創傷比起缺血性骨壞死，更容易直接導致青少年罹患剝脫性骨軟骨炎\[21\]\[22\]。而在成人，[內源性或](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/内源 "wikilink")的創傷亦常是造成剝脫性骨軟骨炎的主因，甚至創傷本身就可以單獨造成本疾病\[23\]。青少年運動員發生[重複使力傷害的發生率近年來逐年上升](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/重複使力傷害 "wikilink")，這可能肇因於就醫頻率的增加\[24\]。這更佐證剝脫性骨軟骨炎可能與運動及其相關損傷相關\[25\]\[26\]。從事體操、足球、籃球、袋棍球、足球、網球、壁球、籃球，及舉重等高衝擊性的活動，可能會使主要受壓關節（膝、踝、肘）發生剝脫性骨軟骨關節炎的機會增加\[27\]\[28\]。

最近的病例報告顯示剝脫性骨軟骨關節炎可能與遺傳相關\[29\]\[30\]\[31\]。有此類遺傳的家族可能有基因變化\[32\]。馬相關的研究也顯示可能有特定的遺傳缺陷\[33\]。

## 病生理學

[Osteochondritis_dissecans_diagram.JPEG](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Osteochondritis_dissecans_diagram.JPEG "fig:Osteochondritis_dissecans_diagram.JPEG") side compared to the [lateral](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/人体解剖学方位 "wikilink") side\]\] 剝脫性骨軟骨炎與磨損性的[退化性關節炎不同](../Page/骨关节炎.md "wikilink")，後者屬於單純關節面的問題，而前者則是軟骨下面的硬骨問題，可能進而導致軟骨的損傷。如果沒有及時治療，剝脫性骨軟骨關節炎可能會引致關節不平衡以及不正常磨損，進而導致退化性關節炎\[34\]。剝脫性骨軟骨炎會發生時，硬骨或軟骨會從骨骼末端鬆離，通常是因為缺乏血液供應或脫鈣導致。鬆解的碎片可能會留在原地或是到處滑移，導致[關節僵硬且不穩定](../Page/关节.md "wikilink")。本疾病可能發生於在身上所有的關節\[35\]，人類最常進犯膝關節\[36\]、踝關節、肘關節\[37\]。

In skeletally immature individuals, the blood supply to the [epiphyseal bone](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/骺板 "wikilink") is good, supporting both  and . With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of [necrosis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/壞死 "wikilink") occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both  and [chondrocytes](../Page/软骨细胞.md "wikilink"). In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral  and consequently OCD.\[38\]

Four minor stages of OCD have been identified after trauma. These include  and formation of granulation (scar) tissue, absorption of necrotic fragments, intertrabecular osteoid deposition, and remodeling of new bone. With delay in the revascularization stage, an OCD lesion develops. A lesion can lead to articular-surface irregularities, which in turn may cause progressive [arthritic](../Page/关节炎.md "wikilink") deterioration.\[39\]

## 診斷

To diagnose osteochondritis dissecans, an [X-ray](../Page/X射线.md "wikilink"), [CT scan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/X射线计算机断层成像 "wikilink") or [MRI scan](../Page/核磁共振成像.md "wikilink") can be performed to show necrosis of subchondral bone, formation of loose fragments, or both.\[40\] Occasionally a [nuclear medicine](../Page/核医学.md "wikilink")  is used to assess the degree of loosening within the joint.\[41\]

### 理學檢查

Physical examination often begins with examination of the patient's . In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid [tibial](../Page/胫骨.md "wikilink") spine impingement on the [lateral](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/人体解剖学方位 "wikilink") aspect of the .\[42\]

Next, the examining physician may check for weakness of the [quadriceps](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/股四頭肌 "wikilink"). This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The  is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the .\[43\] The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of  and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.\[44\]

Physical examination of a patient with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, , and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, , and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both.\[45\] The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are  and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.\[46\]

### 診斷影像學

X-rays show lucency of the [ossification](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/成骨作用 "wikilink") front in juveniles. In older people, the lesion typically appears as an area of  bone with a  line between the osteochondral defect and the [epiphysis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/骨骺 "wikilink"). The visibility of the lesion depends on its location and on the amount of knee  used. Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the site of an OCD lesion.\[47\]

[Magnetic resonance imaging](../Page/核磁共振成像.md "wikilink") (MRI) is useful for staging OCD lesions, evaluating the integrity of the joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage [edema](../Page/水肿.md "wikilink") in the area of the irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the  and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces,  surface integrity, and fragment displacement.\[48\]\[49\] A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures.\[50\] While MRI and [arthroscopy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/关节镜 "wikilink") have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.\[51\]

[Computed tomography](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/X射线计算机断层成像 "wikilink") (CT) scans and [Technetium-99m](../Page/鎝-99m.md "wikilink") s are also sometimes used to monitor the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion.\[52\] Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow and the amount of [osseous](../Page/骨骼.md "wikilink") uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.\[53\]\[54\]

### 分類

OCD is classified by the progression of the disease in stages. There are two main staging classifications used; one is determined by MRI diagnostic imaging while the other is determined [arthroscopically](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/关节镜 "wikilink"). However, both stagings represent the pathological conditions associated with OCD's natural progression.\[55\]

While the arthroscopic classification of bone and cartilage lesions is considered standard, the Anderson MRI staging is the main form of staging used in this article.\[56\] Stages I and II are stable lesions. Stages III and IV describe unstable lesions in which a lesion of the cartilage has allowed  between the fragment and bone.

| Stage | Evaluation | Findings                                                                                          |

| II    | Stable     | The articular cartilage is breached; low signal behind the fragment indicates fibrous attachment  |
| III   | Unstable   | The articular cartilage is breached; high signal behind the fragment indicates loss of attachment |
| IV    | Unstable   | Formation of loose bodies                                                                         |

## 治療

Treatment options include modified activity with or without weight bearing; immobilization; [cryotherapy](../Page/冷療.md "wikilink"); [anti-inflammatory medication](../Page/非甾体抗炎药.md "wikilink"); drilling of subchondral bone; ; removal or reattachment of loose bodies; mosaicplasty and osteoarticular transfer system (OATS) procedures.\[59\]\[60\] The primary goals of treatment are:\[61\]

1.  Enhance the healing potential of subchondral bone;
2.  Fix unstable fragments while maintaining joint congruity; and
3.  Replace damaged bone and cartilage with implanted tissues or cells that can grow cartilage.

The articular cartilage's capacity for repair is limited:\[62\] partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the articular cartilage which fail to penetrate subchondral bone tend to lead to deterioration of the articular surface.\[63\] As a result, surgery is often required in even moderate cases where the osteochondral fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson Stage II, III).\[64\]

### Non-surgical

Candidates for non-operative treatment are limited to skeletally immature teenagers with a relatively small, intact lesion and the absence of loose bodies. Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.\[65\]

Once candidates for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds according to the lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for four to six weeks or even up to six months in  to remove shear stress from the involved area;\[66\] however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted.\[67\]\[68\] Those demonstrating healing by increased  in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.\[69\]

### Surgery

[OATS-Arthroscopic_Scan1.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OATS-Arthroscopic_Scan1.jpg "fig:OATS-Arthroscopic_Scan1.jpg")

The choice of surgical versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial.\[70\] Consequently, the type and extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist for the treatment of persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy  cartilage in [glycosaminoglycan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/糖胺聚糖 "wikilink") concentration, [histological](../Page/组织学.md "wikilink"), and [immunohistochemical](../Page/免疫組織化學.md "wikilink") appearance.\[71\] As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.

#### Intact lesions

If non-surgical measures are unsuccessful, drilling may be considered to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. [Arthroscopic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/关节镜 "wikilink") drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD,\[72\] and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.\[73\]

#### Hinged lesions

Pins and screws can be used to secure flap (sometimes referred to as hinged) lesions.\[74\] Bone pegs, metallic pins and screws, and other bioresorbable screws may be used to secure these types of lesions.\[75\]

#### Full thickness lesions

The three methods most commonly used in treating full thickness lesions are arthroscopic drilling, abrasion, and microfracturing.

In 1946, Magnusson established the use of stem cells from [bone marrow](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/骨髓 "wikilink") with the first surgical  of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into  and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal  and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this can be attributed to the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.\[76\]

In attempts to address the weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques have been designed to fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is  [chondrocyte](../Page/软骨细胞.md "wikilink") implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated [femoral](../Page/股骨.md "wikilink") defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the  of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations.\[77\]\[78\] However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.\[79\]

Similar to OATS, arthroscopic articular cartilage paste grafting is a surgical procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. A bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.\[80\]

#### Unstable lesions

Some methods of fixation for unstable lesions include countersunk compression screws and  or pins made of stainless steel or materials that can be absorbed by the body.\[81\] If loose bodies are found, they are removed. Although each case is unique and treatment is chosen on an individual basis, ACI is generally performed on large defects in skeletally mature people.

#### Rehabilitation

Continuous passive motion (CPM) has been used to improve healing of the articular surface during the postoperative period for people with full-thickness lesions. It has been shown to promote articular cartilage healing for small (\< 3 mm in diameter) lesions in rabbits.\[82\] Similarly, Rodrigo and Steadman reported that CPM for six hours per day for eight weeks produced an improved clinical outcome in humans.\[83\]

A rehabilitation program often involves protection of the compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative [analgesics](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/镇痛药 "wikilink"), namely a mix of [opioids](../Page/鴉片類藥物.md "wikilink") and [NSAIDs](../Page/非甾体抗炎药.md "wikilink"), are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling.\[84\] Straight leg raising and other s are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal [physical therapy](../Page/物理治療.md "wikilink") program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.\[85\]

## 預後

The prognosis after different treatments varies and is based on several factors which include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate.\[86\] It follows that the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting children between the ages of 5 and 15 years.\[87\] The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.\[88\]

The prognosis is good for stable lesions (stage I and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal.\[89\] Recovery in juveniles can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes ([stem cells](../Page/間充質幹細胞.md "wikilink")) which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow for more of the stem cells necessary for repair in the affected joint.\[90\] Unstable, large, full-thickness lesions (stage III and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.\[91\]\[92\]

## 流行病學

OCD is a relatively rare disorder, with an estimated [incidence](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/发病率 "wikilink") of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year.\[93\] Widuchowski W *et al.* found OCD to be the cause of articular cartilage defects in 2% of cases in a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies.\[94\] Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1.\[95\]\[96\] However, OCD has become more common among adolescent females as they become more active in sports.\[97\] The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.\[98\]

While OCD may affect any joint, the knee—specifically the  in 75–85% of knee cases—tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases.\[99\]\[100\]\[101\]\[102\] The elbow (specifically the ) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the [talar dome](../Page/距骨.md "wikilink") of the ankle represents 4% of cases.\[103\] Less frequent locations include the [patella](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/髌骨 "wikilink"), , the femoral head, and the  of the scapula.\[104\]

-----

The incidence of OCD is approximately 15 to 29 per 100,000 patients.10,14 A steady rise in this number is likely secondary to increased provider awareness, more frequent use of advanced imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), introduction of sports at a younger age, increased intensity of sports participation, and early sport specialization. In general males are affected more often than females, with a reported male-to-female ratio of 5:3.15 However, the gender gap is decreasing coincident with increased female sports participation. The age of presentation averages 14 years for juvenile lesions and 26 years for adult lesions.16 Modern changes in sports participation also have impacted the age of presentation, with juvenile patients presenting at an increasingly younger age.\[105\]

## 歷史

The condition was initially described by  in 1738.\[106\] In 1870,  described the disease process for the first time, but it was not until 1887 that  published a paper on the cause of loose bodies in the joint.\[107\] In his paper, König concluded that:\[108\]

1.  Trauma had to be very severe to break off parts of the joint surface.
2.  Less severe trauma might contuse the bone to cause an area of necrosis which might then separate.
3.  In some cases, the absence of notable trauma made it likely that there existed some spontaneous cause of separation.

König named the disease "osteochondritis dissecans",\[109\] describing it as a subchondral inflammatory process of the knee, resulting in a loose fragment of cartilage from the femoral condyle. In 1922, Kappis described this process in the ankle joint.\[110\] On review of all literature describing transchondral fractures of the [talus](../Page/距骨.md "wikilink"), Berndt and Harty developed a classification system for staging of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs).\[111\] The term osteochondritis dissecans has persisted, and has since been broadened to describe a similar process occurring in many other joints, including the knee, hip, elbow, and .\[112\]\[113\]

Bar = 200 [μm](../Page/微米.md "wikilink").\]\] OCD also is found in animals, and is of particular concern in horses, as there may be a hereditary component in some s.\[120\] Feeding for forced growth and [selective breeding](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/人工選擇 "wikilink") for increased size are also factors. OCD has also been studied in other animals—mainly dogs, especially the [German Shepherd](../Page/德國牧羊犬.md "wikilink")\[121\]—where it is a common primary cause of  in medium-large breeds.\[122\]

In animals, OCD is considered a developmental and metabolic disorder related to cartilage growth and endochondral [ossification](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/成骨作用 "wikilink"). Osteochondritis itself signifies the disturbance of the usual growth process of cartilage, and OCD is the term used when this affects joint cartilage causing a fragment to become loose.\[123\]

According to the Columbia Animal Hospital the frequency of affected animals is dogs, humans, pigs, horses, cattle, chickens, and turkeys, and in dogs the most commonly affected breeds include the German Shepherd, Golden and Labrador Retriever, Rottweiler, Great Dane, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Saint Bernard.\[124\] Although any joint may be affected, those commonly affected by OCD in the dog are: shoulder (often bilaterally), elbow, knee and .\[125\]

The problem develops in puppyhood although often subclinically, and there may be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, [arthroscopy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/关节镜 "wikilink"), or [MRI](../Page/核磁共振成像.md "wikilink") scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness. Surgery is recommended once the animal has been deemed lame.\[126\]

Osteochondritis dissecans is difficult to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as .\[127\]

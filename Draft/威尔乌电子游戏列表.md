[Valve_logo.svg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Valve_logo.svg "fig:Valve_logo.svg") [Valve Corporation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation "wikilink") is an American [video game developer](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/video_game_developer "wikilink") and [publisher](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_publisher "wikilink") founded in 1996 by [Gabe Newell](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Newell "wikilink") and [Mike Harrington](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Harrington "wikilink"). The company is based in [Bellevue, Washington](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington "wikilink").\[1\] Valve's first game was *[Half-Life](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_\(video_game\) "wikilink")*, a [first-person shooter](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-person_shooter "wikilink") released in 1998.\[2\] It received universal acclaim and sold over nine million retail copies.\[3\]\[4\] Alongside *Half-Life*{{'}}s launch, Valve released development tools to enable the player community to create content and [mods](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_\(video_gaming\) "wikilink").\[5\] The company then proceeded to hire the creators of popular mods, such as *[Counter-Strike](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike_\(video_game\) "wikilink")*, which became the most popular multiplayer first-person shooter for the next decade.\[6\]

Valve continued their trend of developing predominantly [first-person](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_\(video_games\) "wikilink") video games in the 2000s with a number of critically successful releases. In 2004, they released the highly anticipated sequel *[Half-Life 2](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2 "wikilink")* through their own digital distribution service [Steam](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_\(software\) "wikilink"). The game sold over 10 million copies and was met with acclaim. Valve released two subsequent episodes for *Half-Life 2* and later packaged those games together with the puzzle game *[Portal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_\(video_game\) "wikilink")* and the multiplayer shooter *[Team Fortress 2](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2 "wikilink")* in a collection known as *[The Orange Box](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_Box "wikilink")*.\[7\] By the end of 2008, combined retail sales of the [*Half-Life* series](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_\(series\) "wikilink"), [*Counter-Strike* series](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike "wikilink") and *The Orange Box* had surpassed 32 million units.\[8\] Newell also projected that digital sales of Valve's games would eventually exceed retail sales as Steam continued to grow.\[9\]\[10\] In the late 2000s, Valve released two zombie-themed first-person shooters focusing on [cooperative gameplay](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/cooperative_gameplay "wikilink") with the [*Left 4 Dead* series](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_4_Dead_\(series\) "wikilink"). The company continued to release multiplayer games with the launches of *[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive "wikilink")* and *[Dota 2](../Page/Dota_2.md "wikilink")*,\[11\] both of which have large [esports](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/esports "wikilink") communities fostered by Valve.\[12\] During the 2010s, Valve began focusing on supporting their established multiplayer titles with regular content updates.\[13\]\[14\]\[15\]\[16\] In the late 2010s, Valve began investing in [virtual reality](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/virtual_reality "wikilink") and started to develop games and other software that make use of the technology.\[17\]

Valve is considered to be one of the most important and influential companies in the gaming industry.\[18\] The reception of their games, along with the creation of Steam, has prompted some publications to list Valve as one of the top game developers of all time,\[19\]\[20\] and the most powerful company in [PC gaming](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game "wikilink").\[21\] In 2013, Newell received a [BAFTA Fellowship](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Fellowship "wikilink") award with the BAFTA Games Committee recognizing the impact Valve had left on the gaming industry in producing critically and commercially successfully game franchises.\[22\]

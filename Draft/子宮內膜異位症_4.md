### 分期 Staging

Surgically, endometriosis can be staged I–IV by the revised classification of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine from 1997. The process is a complex point system that assesses lesions and adhesions in the pelvic organs, but it is important to note staging assesses physical disease only, not the level of pain or infertility. A person with Stage I endometriosis may have a little disease and severe pain, while a person with Stage IV endometriosis may have severe disease and no pain or vice versa. In principle the various stages show these findings:

在醫學上，從1997年美國生殖醫學學會提出的分類看，子宮內膜異位症可分為1～4期。這個分類是一個複雜的定位系統，通過骨盆腔器官的病變和沾黏來確定分類，而不是通過疼痛和不孕症狀的程度來確認。比如1個人在第1期子宮內膜異位症時，可能只有一點炎症但非常疼痛，而另外一個人可能已經到了4期，可能有很嚴重的炎症但沒有疼痛或者反之亦然。原則上，不同期有這些發現：

第一期 Stage I (Minimal)

  -
    Findings restricted to only superficial lesions and possibly a few filmy adhesions
    研究發現只限於浅層病变和可能的一些薄膜状粘连

第二期 Stage II (Mild)

  -
    In addition, some deep lesions are present in the cul-de-sac
    除此之外，在直腸子宮陷凹的地方有一些深度的病變。

第三期 Stage III (Moderate)

  -
    As above, plus the presence of Endometriomas on the ovary and more adhesions.
    除了上述症狀，還有形成卵巢子宮內膜異位症。

第四期 Stage IV (Severe)

  -
    As above, plus large endometriomas, extensive adhesions.
    上述外，還有廣泛及大量的子宮內膜異位和沾黏

### 血液指標 Markers\[edit source\]

An area of research is the search for endometriosis markers.

子宮內膜異位症的指標研究是這個研究領域的一個分支。

In 2010, essentially all proposed biomarkers for endometriosis were of unclear medical use, although some appear to be promising. The one biomarker that has been in use over the last 20 years is CA-125. A 2016 review found that in those with symptoms of endometriosis; and, once ovarian cancer has been ruled out, a positive CA-125 may confirm the diagnosis. Its performance in ruling out endometriosis is low. CA-125 levels appear to fall during endometriosis treatment, but has not shown a correlation with disease response.

在2010年，基本上所有子宮內膜異位症的生物指標都有沒有明確的醫學用途，雖然有些症狀可能有前景。其中一個生物指標——CA-125——已被沿用超過20年。一個2016的研究發現一旦排除了卵巢癌，同時具備相關症狀，通過CA-125阳性可确診。如果出現以上症狀，被排除子宮內膜異位症的概率是低的。

Another review in 2011 identified several putative biomarkers upon biopsy, including findings of small sensory nerve fibers or defectively expressed β3 integrin subunit. It has been postulated a future diagnostic tool for endometriosis will consist of a panel of several specific and sensitive biomarkers, including both substance concentrations and genetic predisposition.

A 2016 review of endometrial biomarkers for diagnosing endometriosis was unable to draw conclusions due to the low quality of the evidence.

### Histopathology\[edit source\]

Endometriosis, abdominal wall Micrograph showing endometriosis (right) and ovarian stroma (left). H\&E stain. Micrograph of the wall of an endometrioma. All features of endometriosis are present (endometrial glands, endometrial stroma and hemosiderin-laden macrophages). H\&E stain. Typical endometriotic lesions show histopathologic features similar to endometrium, namely endometrial stroma, endometrial epithelium, and glands that respond to hormonal stimuli. Older lesions may display no glands but hemosiderin deposits (see photomicrograph on right) as residual.<sup>\[*citation needed*\]</sup>

Immunohistochemistry has been found to be useful in diagnosing endometriosis as stromal cells have a peculiar surface antigen, CD10, thus allowing the pathologist go straight to a staining area and hence confirm the presence of stromal cells and sometimes glandular tissue is thus identified that was missed on routine H\&E staining.<sup>\[*better source needed*\]</sup>

### Pain quantification\[edit source\]

The most common pain scale for quantification of endometriosis-related pain is the visual analogue scale (VAS); VAS and numerical rating scale (NRS) were the best adapted pain scales for pain measurement in endometriosis. For research purposes, and for more detailed pain measurement in clinical practice, VAS or NRS for each type of typical pain related to endometriosis (dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia and non-menstrual chronic pelvic pain), combined with the clinical global impression (CGI) and a quality of life scale, are used.

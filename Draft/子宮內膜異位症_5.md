**子宮內膜異位症**（）屬於[婦科疾病](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/婦科 "wikilink")，指的是本當存在於[子宮內的組織卻在子宮外的其他地方生長](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/子宮 "wikilink")\[1\]\[2\]，主要的症狀有以及[不孕](../Page/不孕.md "wikilink")\[3\]。有近一半的患者有的困擾，更有七成的疼痛感發生在[經期](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/經期 "wikilink")\[4\]，性交時會產生疼痛感的主訴也算常見\[5\]，有五成的病人更罹患了不孕症\[6\]。子宮內膜異位症會對病人的社交生活與心靈造成影響\[7\]。有極少數的病患有排尿或腸部分的病徵。約25%的患者沒有任何症狀\[8\]。子宮內膜異位症可能造成社會與心理的問題\[9\]。

造成子宮內膜異位症的原因尚未有定論\[10\]，但危險因子包括有家族病史等\[11\]。大多數的病患在患病後在[卵巢](../Page/卵巢.md "wikilink")、[輸卵管和子宮周圍的組織會有感染與影響](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/輸卵管 "wikilink")，而且，甚至有極少數的患者在身體的其他部位也會產生感染\[12\]。因子宮內膜異位症而每月造成出血的部位會有發炎與留疤的疑慮\[13\]\[14\]，此疾病而促使的細胞生長並不是癌症\[15\]。診斷常是依據症狀並結合[醫學影像](../Page/醫學影像.md "wikilink")技術\[16\]。[活體組織切片](../Page/活體組織切片.md "wikilink")是所有檢驗當中最精確的方法\[17\]。會引起相同症狀的疾病包括有：[大腸激躁症](../Page/大腸激躁症.md "wikilink")、[間質性膀胱炎](../Page/間質性膀胱炎.md "wikilink")，和[纖維肌痛](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/纖維肌痛 "wikilink")\[18\]。子宮內膜異位症時常遭到誤診，許多患者可能會被錯誤診斷為正常\[19\]。

一些實驗證據顯示，服用[複合口服避孕藥能降低罹患子宮內膜異位症的機率](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/複合口服避孕藥 "wikilink")\[20\]，大量的運動以及避免飲用大量酒精飲料也同樣有預防效果\[21\]。目前沒有針對此症而開發的特效藥，但有多項醫療方法可改善症狀\[22\] 。上述提到的方法包括有使用[止痛藥](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/止痛藥 "wikilink")、賀爾蒙藥物或透過手術來達到幫助病人的目的\[23\]。推薦患者服用的止痛藥通常為例如[萘普生](../Page/萘普生.md "wikilink")類的[非類固醇類抗發炎藥](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/非類固醇類抗發炎藥 "wikilink")\[24\]。連續使用避孕藥中的活性成分或裝設[子宮內避孕器都視為對抗子宮內膜異位症的有效方法](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/子宮內避孕器 "wikilink")\[25\]。能多少協助因罹患此疾病而不孕的婦女[懷孕](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/懷孕 "wikilink")\[26\]。對於症狀無法藉由藥物來控制的病患，則可以考慮進行手術\[27\]。

2015年，全球估計有1080萬人罹患子宮內膜異位症\[28\]。目前估計約有6-10%的婦女有子宮內膜異位症的困擾\[29\]，病患多為30-40歲的女性，但最早也可能發生於8歲\[30\]\[31\]。有些微的致死率，而在2013年時，約造成200名患者死亡\[32\]。1920年代，第一次認定為疾病的一種，在那之前，子宮內膜異位症都覺得和[子宮肌腺瘤是相同的](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/子宮肌腺瘤 "wikilink")\[33\]，對於誰是第一個明確描述此惡疾的，尚未有一個定論\[34\]。

## 症狀與徵象

[Blausen_0349_Endometriosis.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blausen_0349_Endometriosis.png "fig:Blausen_0349_Endometriosis.png") Pain and infertility are common symptoms, although 20-25% of women are asymptomatic.\[35\]

### Pelvic pain

A major symptom of endometriosis is recurring [pelvic pain](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/pelvic_pain "wikilink"). The pain can range from mild to severe cramping or stabbing pain that occurs on both sides of the pelvis, in the lower back and rectal area, and even down the legs. The amount of pain a woman feels correlates weakly with the extent or stage (1 through 4) of endometriosis, with some women having little or no pain despite having extensive endometriosis or endometriosis with scarring, while other women may have severe pain even though they have only a few small areas of endometriosis.\[36\] The most severe pain is typically associated with menstruation. Pain can also start a week before a menstrual period, during and even a week after a menstrual period, or it can be constant. The pain can be debilitating and result in emotional stress.\[37\] Symptoms of endometriosis-related pain may include:

  - [dysmenorrhea](../Page/經痛.md "wikilink") – painful, sometimes disabling cramps during the menstrual period; pain may get worse over time (progressive pain), also lower back pains linked to the pelvis

  - – typically accompanied by lower back pain or abdominal pain

  - [dyspareunia](../Page/性交疼痛.md "wikilink") – painful [sexual intercourse](../Page/性交.md "wikilink")

  - [dysuria](../Page/排尿疼痛.md "wikilink") – urinary urgency, frequency, and sometimes painful voiding \[38\]

  - – pain associated with ovulation\[39\]

  - bodily movement pain – present during exercise, standing, or walking\[40\]

Compared with women with superficial endometriosis, those with deep disease appear to be more likely to report shooting rectal pain and a sense of their insides being pulled down.\[41\] Individual pain areas and pain intensity appear to be unrelated to the surgical diagnosis, and the area of pain unrelated to area of endometriosis.\[42\]

There are multiple causes of pain. Endometriosis lesions react to hormonal stimulation and may "bleed" at the time of menstruation. The blood accumulates locally if it is not cleared shortly by the immune, circulatory, and lymphatic system. This may further lead to swelling, which triggers inflammation with the activation of [cytokines](../Page/细胞因子.md "wikilink"), which results in pain. Another source of pain is the organ dislocation that arises from [adhesion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/沾黏 "wikilink") binding internal organs to each other. The ovaries, the uterus, the oviducts, the peritoneum, and the bladder can be bound together. Pain triggered in this way can last throughout the menstrual cycle, not just during menstrual periods.\[43\]

Also, endometriotic lesions can develop their own nerve supply, thereby creating a direct and two-way interaction between lesions and the [central nervous system](../Page/中樞神經系統.md "wikilink"), potentially producing a variety of individual differences in pain that can, in some women, become independent of the disease itself.\[44\] Nerve fibres and blood vessels are thought to grow into endometriosis lesions by a process known as .\[45\]

### 不孕

About a third of women with [infertility](../Page/不孕.md "wikilink") have endometriosis.\[46\] Among women with endometriosis about 40% are infertile.\[47\] The pathogenesis of infertility is dependent on the stage of disease: in early stage disease, it is hypothesised that this is secondary to an inflammatory response that impairs various aspects of conception, whereas in later stage disease distorted pelvic anatomy and adhesions contribute to impaired fertilisation.\[48\]

### 其他

Other symptoms include diarrhea or [constipation](../Page/便秘.md "wikilink"), chronic fatigue, nausea and vomiting, headaches, low-grade fevers, heavy and/or irregular periods, and hypoglycemia.\[49\]\[50\]\[51\]

There is an association between endometriosis and certain types of cancers, notably some types of [ovarian cancer](../Page/卵巢癌.md "wikilink"),\[52\]\[53\] [non-Hodgkin's lymphoma](../Page/非霍奇金氏淋巴瘤.md "wikilink") and [brain cancer](../Page/脑肿瘤.md "wikilink").\[54\] Endometriosis is unrelated to [endometrial cancer](../Page/子宫内膜癌.md "wikilink").\[55\]

Rarely, endometriosis can cause endometrial tissue to be found in other parts of the body.  occurs when endometrial tissue implants in the lungs or pleura. Manifestations of this include [coughing up blood](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/咳血 "wikilink"), a [collapsed lung](../Page/氣胸.md "wikilink"), or .\[56\]

## 風險因子

### 遺傳學

子宮內膜異位症是一種受遺傳和環境因素影響遺傳性疾病\[57\]。 患者的一等直系血親及姊妹患有子宮內膜異位症也有較高風險；[黃體素水平低可能是遺傳性原因](../Page/孕酮.md "wikilink")，從而導致激素失衡\[58\]。 如果一等親女性血親中有人患有此疾病，其發病率大約會增加六倍\[59\]。

有研究指出，子宮內膜異位症的形成來自針對目標基因內的多重打擊，此機制與癌症的發展過程類似。而初始的突變有可能是體細胞性，也可能是遺傳性\[60\]。

與子宮內膜異位症相關的個體基因組變化包括\[61\]\[62\]\[63\]：

目前的研究中發現很多[基因表達和](../Page/基因表現.md "wikilink")[表觀遺傳學](../Page/表觀遺傳學.md "wikilink")上的變異，但這兩者也可能是其他因素所導致的，例如環境因素或新陳代謝改變等。例如[miRNA等](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/miRNA "wikilink")，可能會產生基因表達的差異\[64\]。

### 環境毒素

可能導致子宮內膜異位的一些因素包括：

  - 雌激素暴露時間延長。例如，更年期過晚\[65\]或者月經過早\[66\]\[67\]。
  - 月經不暢；例如，苗勒管發育異常\[68\]。

一些研究調查了[二噁英](../Page/二噁英.md "wikilink")暴露與子宮內膜異位之間的潛在聯繫，但其所提供的證據模稜兩可，對其潛在的機制也解釋不足\[69\]。 2004年發表的一份評論對二噁英與子宮內膜異位症關聯的研究現狀進行了總結：「能夠支持二噁英與子宮內膜異位症關聯的數據稀少且相互矛盾，」\[70\]。而2009年發表的一份跟進評論也發現「缺乏足夠的證據」來證明二噁英與子宮內膜異位症之間的聯繫\[71\]。一份2008年的回顧性論文提出目前仍然需要更多此方面的工作：「儘管一些初步的研究顯示了暴露於二噁英的環境可能誘發子宮內膜異位症，但仍需進行大量的研究來明確其具體因果關係、並了解其潛在的毒性機制。」\[72\]。

## 病生理學

[Peritoneal_endometriosis.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Peritoneal_endometriosis.jpg "fig:Peritoneal_endometriosis.jpg")中的子宮內膜病灶影像\]\] 關於子宮內膜異位症的真正成因尚未完全闡明，目前已有許多假說嘗試解釋此一疾病，不同理論之間並非完全互斥。子宮內膜異位症的可能是一個多因子性的疾病\[73\]。

### 形成

異位子宮內膜形成理論中的主流有月經逆流（retrograde menstruation）、苗勒上皮異位症（Müllerianosis）、體腔化生（coelomic metaplasia）等，以下將分別進行介紹。

#### 月經逆流理論

月經逆行理論（或稱植入理論或移行理論）\[74\]是最早關於子宮內膜異位症形成的理論\[75\]。該理論認為患者的[月經血流](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/经期 "wikilink")，有些碎片經由輸卵管倒流至腹腔，沾黏在腹膜表面（腹腔的表面）後，造成組織進犯，成為異位子宮內膜\[76\]。

Retrograde menstruation alone is not able to explain all instances of endometriosis, and additional factors such as genetic or immune differences need to be invoked to account for the fact that many women with retrograde menstruation do not have endometriosis. In addition, endometriosis has shown up in people who have never experienced menstruation including men,\[77\] fetuses,\[78\] and prepubescent girls.\[79\]\[80\] Further detracting from the retrograde menstruation theory are cases of endometriosis showing up in the brain\[81\] and lungs.\[82\] This theory has numerous other associated issues.\[83\]

Researchers are investigating the possibility that the [immune system](../Page/免疫系统.md "wikilink") may not be able to cope with the cyclic onslaught of retrograde menstrual fluid. In this context there is interest in studying the relationship of endometriosis to [autoimmune disease](../Page/自體免疫性疾病.md "wikilink"), [allergic](../Page/过敏.md "wikilink") reactions, and the impact of toxic materials.\[84\]\[85\] It is still unclear what, if any, causal relationship exists between toxic materials, autoimmune disease, and endometriosis. There are immune system changes in women with endometriosis, such as an increase of macrophage-derived secretion products, but it is unknown if these are contributing to the disorder or are reactions from it.\[86\]

In addition, at least one study found that endometriotic lesions differ in their biochemistry from artificially transplanted ectopic tissue.\[87\] This is likely because the cells that give rise to endometriosis are a side population of cells.\[88\] Similarly, there are changes in for example the [mesothelium](../Page/間皮細胞.md "wikilink") of the [peritoneum](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/peritoneum "wikilink") in women with endometriosis, such as loss of [tight junctions](../Page/紧密连接.md "wikilink"), but it is unknown if these are causes or effects of the disorder.\[89\]

In rare cases where  does not resolve itself prior to the first menstrual cycle and goes undetected, blood and [endometrium](../Page/子宮內膜.md "wikilink") are trapped within the uterus of the woman until such time as the problem is resolved by surgical incision. Many health care practitioners never encounter this defect, and due to the  it is often misdiagnosed or overlooked until multiple menstrual cycles have passed. By the time a correct diagnosis has been made, endometrium and other fluids have filled the uterus and Fallopian tubes with results similar to retrograde menstruation resulting in endometriosis. The initial stage of endometriosis may vary based on the time elapsed between onset and surgical procedure.

The theory of retrograde menstruation as a cause of endometriosis was first proposed by .

#### 其他理論

  - Stem cells: Endometriosis may arise from stem cells from bone marrow and potentially other sources. In particular, this theory explains endometriosis found in areas remote from the pelvis such as the brain or lungs.\[90\]
  - Environment: Environmental toxins (e.g., [dioxin](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/戴奧辛 "wikilink"), [nickel](../Page/镍.md "wikilink")) may cause endometriosis.\[91\]\[92\]
  - Müllerianosis: A theory supported by foetal autopsy is that cells with the potential to become endometrial, which are laid down in tracts during embryonic development called the female reproductive (Müllerian) tract as it migrates downward at 8–10 weeks of embryonic life, could become dislocated from the migrating uterus and act like seeds or [stem cells](../Page/幹細胞.md "wikilink").\[93\]
  - Coelomic metaplasia: [Coelomic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/体腔 "wikilink") cells which are the common ancestor of [endometrial](../Page/子宮內膜.md "wikilink") and [peritoneal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/腹膜 "wikilink") cells may undergo  (transformation) from one type of cell to the other, perhaps triggered by inflammation.\[94\]
  - Vasculogenesis: Up to 37% of the microvascular [endothelium](../Page/內皮.md "wikilink") of ectopic endometrial tissue originates from s, which result in *de novo* formation of microvessels by the process of  rather than the conventional process of [angiogenesis](../Page/血管新生.md "wikilink").\[95\]
  - Neural growth: An increased expression of new nerve fibres is found in endometriosis but does not fully explain the formation of ectopic endometrial tissue and is not definitely correlated with the amount of perceived pain.\[96\]
  - Autoimmune: [Graves disease](../Page/弥漫性毒性甲状腺肿.md "wikilink") is an autoimmune disease characterized by hyperthyroidism, goiter, ophthalmopathy, and dermopathy. Women with endometriosis had higher rates of Graves disease. One of these potential links between Graves disease and endometriosis is .\[97\]\[98\]
  - [Oxidative stress](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/氧化应激 "wikilink"): Influx of Iron is associated with the local destruction of the peritoneal [mesothelium](../Page/間皮細胞.md "wikilink"), leading to the adhesion of  endometrial cells.\[99\] Peritoneal iron overload has been suggested to be caused by the destruction of [erythrocytes](../Page/红血球.md "wikilink"), which contain the iron-binding protein hemoglobin, or a deficiency in the peritoneal [iron metabolism system.](../Page/人類鐵代謝.md "wikilink")\[100\] Oxidative stress activity and [reactive oxygen species](../Page/活性氧类.md "wikilink") (such as [superoxide anions](../Page/超氧化物.md "wikilink") and [peroxide](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/过氧化物 "wikilink") levels) are reported to be higher than normal in people with endometriosis.\[101\] Oxidative stress and the presence of excess ROS can damage tissue and induce rapid [cellular division](../Page/细胞分裂.md "wikilink").\[102\] Mechanistically, there are several cellular pathways by which oxidative stress may lead to or may induce proliferation of endometriotic lesions, including the  (MAP) kinase pathway and the extracellular signal-related kinase () pathway.\[103\] Activation of both of the MAP and ERK pathways lead to increased levels of  and , which are [proto-oncogenes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/癌基因 "wikilink") that are associated with [high-grade lesions](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/腫瘤分級 "wikilink").\[104\]

### Localization

[Endometriosis_loc_en.svg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Endometriosis_loc_en.svg "fig:Endometriosis_loc_en.svg") Most often, endometriosis is found on the:

  - [ovaries](../Page/卵巢.md "wikilink")
  - [fallopian tubes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/输卵管 "wikilink")
  - tissues that hold the uterus in place ([ligaments](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/韧带 "wikilink"))
  - outer surface of the uterus\[105\]

Less common sites are:

  - [vagina](../Page/阴道.md "wikilink")
  - [cervix](../Page/子宮頸.md "wikilink")
  - [vulva](../Page/女陰.md "wikilink")
  - [bowel](../Page/消化道.md "wikilink")
  - [bladder](../Page/膀胱.md "wikilink")
  - [rectum](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/直肠 "wikilink")\[106\]

Rarely, endometriosis appears in other parts of the body, such as the [lungs](../Page/肺.md "wikilink"), [brain](../Page/脑.md "wikilink"), and [skin](../Page/皮膚.md "wikilink").\[107\]

Rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis affects approximately 5-12% of women with endometriosis, and can cause severe pain with bowel movements.\[108\]

Endometriosis may spread to the [cervix](../Page/子宮頸.md "wikilink") and [vagina](../Page/阴道.md "wikilink") or to sites of a surgical abdominal incision, known as "scar endometriosis."\[109\] Risk factors for scar endometriosis include previous abdominal surgeries, such as a hysterotomy or cesarean section, or ectopic pregnancies, salpingostomy puerperal sterilization, laparoscopy, amniocentesis, appendectomy, episiotomy, vaginal hysterectomies, and hernia repair.\[110\]\[111\]\[112\]

Endometriosis may also present with skin lesions in .

Less commonly lesions can be found on the diaphragm. Diaphragmatic endometriosis is rare, almost always on the right hemidiaphragm, and may inflict the cyclic pain of the right shoulder just before and during a menstrual period. Rarely, endometriosis can be extraperitoneal and is found in the lungs and CNS.\[113\]

## 診斷

[Douglas_endometriose.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Douglas_endometriose.jpg "fig:Douglas_endometriose.jpg") and on the right [sacrouterine ligament](../Page/子宫骶韧带.md "wikilink")\]\] 病史詢問及理學檢查可以協助醫療照護者進行子宮內膜異位症的診斷。目前診斷子宮內膜異位症的標準診斷為診斷性手術，非侵入性檢查的優缺點尚不明朗\[114\]。在英國，婦女從因症狀首次求診到真正確診平均約需7.5年\[115\]。

### 腹腔鏡

[Endometrioma.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Endometrioma.jpg "fig:Endometrioma.jpg") as distinguished from other types of [ovarian cysts](../Page/卵巢囊腫.md "wikilink") by a somewhat grainy and not completely [anechoic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/消音室 "wikilink") content\]\] [腹腔鏡是一種藉由影像技術探視腹腔內情況的外科手術](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/腹腔鏡 "wikilink")，是目前唯一確診子宮內膜異位症的方法\[116\]。有些內膜異位症的位置會暴露到體表之外，例如說位於陰道的子宮內膜結節\[117\]。若無暴露到體表位置則可使用[組織切片的方式確認診斷](../Page/活體組織切片.md "wikilink")\[118\]。腹腔鏡除了具有診斷功能之外，也能夠同時進行手術。

During a laparoscopic procedure lesions can appear dark blue, powder-burn black, red, white, yellow, brown or non-pigmented. Lesions vary in size.\[119\] Some within the pelvis walls may not be visible, as normal-appearing peritoneum of infertile women reveals endometriosis on biopsy in 6–13% of cases.\[120\] Early endometriosis typically occurs on the surfaces of organs in the pelvic and intra-abdominal areas.\[121\] Health care providers may call areas of endometriosis by different names, such as implants, lesions, or nodules. Larger lesions may be seen within the ovaries as [endometriomas](../Page/子宮內膜異位瘤.md "wikilink") or "chocolate cysts", "chocolate" because they contain a thick brownish fluid, mostly old blood.\[122\]

Frequently during diagnostic , no lesions are found in women with chronic pelvic pain, a symptom common to other disorders including [adenomyosis](../Page/子宫腺肌病.md "wikilink"), pelvic adhesions, [pelvic inflammatory disease](../Page/骨盆腔發炎.md "wikilink"), [congenital anomalies](../Page/先天性障碍.md "wikilink") of the [reproductive tract](../Page/生殖系统.md "wikilink"), and ovarian or tubal masses.\[123\]

### 超音波

Use of pelvic ultrasound may identify large endometriotic cysts (called [endometriomas](../Page/子宮內膜異位瘤.md "wikilink")). However, smaller endometriosis implants cannot be visualized with ultrasound technique.\[124\]

Vaginal ultrasound has a clinical value in the diagnosis of endometrioma and before operating for deep endometriosis.\[125\] This applies to the identification of the spread of disease in women with well-established clinical suspicion of endometriosis.\[126\] Vaginal ultrasound is inexpensive, easily accessible, has no contraindications and requires no preparation.\[127\] Healthcare professionals conducting ultrasound examinations need to be experienced.\[128\] By extending the ultrasound assessment into the posterior and anterior pelvic compartments the sonographer is able to evaluate structural mobility and look for deep infiltrating endometriotic nodules noting the size, location and distance from the anus if applicable.\[129\] An improvement in sonographic detection of deep infiltrating endometriosis will not only reduce the number of diagnostic laparoscopies, it will guide management and enhance quality of life.\[130\]

### 核磁共振

Use of MRIs is another method to detect lesions in a non-invasive manner.\[131\] MRI is not widely used due to its cost and limited availability, however, it has the ability to detect deep and small endometriotic lesions.\[132\]

### 分期

1997年將子宮內膜異位症分為1～4期\[133\]。該分期是一個複雜的積分系統，需評估骨盆腔器官的病變和沾黏以進行分期，疼痛和不孕症狀的程度則不列入計算。有些人在第1期子宮內膜異位症時，可能疾病相當輕微但卻非常疼痛；而有些人則雖然已經到了4期，可能沾黏相當嚴重但卻沒有疼痛，反之亦然。原則上，不同分期會有下列這些表現：\[134\]

第一期

  -
    Findings restricted to only superficial lesions and possibly a few filmy [adhesions](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/沾黏 "wikilink")

第二期

  -
    In addition, some deep lesions are present in the

第三期

  -
    As above, plus the presence of endometriomas on the ovary and more adhesions.

第四期

  -
    As above, plus large endometriomas, extensive adhesions.

### Markers

An area of research is the search for endometriosis [markers](../Page/生物标记.md "wikilink").\[135\]

In 2010, essentially all proposed biomarkers for endometriosis were of unclear medical use, although some appear to be promising.\[136\] The one biomarker that has been in use over the last 20 years is [CA-125](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-125 "wikilink").\[137\] A 2016 review found that in those with symptoms of endometriosis; and, once [ovarian cancer](../Page/卵巢癌.md "wikilink") has been ruled out, a positive CA-125 may confirm the diagnosis.\[138\] Its performance in ruling out endometriosis is low.\[139\] CA-125 levels appear to fall during endometriosis treatment, but has not shown a correlation with disease response.\[140\]

Another review in 2011 identified several putative biomarkers upon biopsy, including findings of small sensory nerve fibers or defectively expressed [β3 integrin](../Page/CD61.md "wikilink") subunit.\[141\] It has been postulated a future diagnostic tool for endometriosis will consist of a panel of several specific and sensitive biomarkers, including both substance concentrations and genetic predisposition.\[142\]

A 2016 review of endometrial biomarkers for diagnosing endometriosis was unable to draw conclusions due to the low quality of the evidence.\[143\]

### Histopathology

Typical endometriotic lesions show  features similar to [endometrium](../Page/子宮內膜.md "wikilink"), namely endometrial , endometrial [epithelium](../Page/上皮組織.md "wikilink"), and glands that respond to hormonal stimuli. Older lesions may display no glands but  deposits (see photomicrograph on right) as residual.

Immunohistochemistry has been found to be useful in diagnosing endometriosis as stromal cells have a peculiar surface antigen, CD10, thus allowing the pathologist go straight to a staining area and hence confirm the presence of stromal cells and sometimes glandular tissue is thus identified that was missed on routine H\&E staining.\[144\]

All features of endometriosis are present (endometrial [glands](../Page/腺.md "wikilink"), endometrial  and -laden [macrophages](../Page/巨噬细胞.md "wikilink")).

### Pain quantification

The most common [pain scale](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/pain_scale "wikilink") for quantification of endometriosis-related pain is the  (VAS); VAS and  (NRS) were the best adapted pain scales for pain measurement in endometriosis. For research purposes, and for more detailed pain measurement in clinical practice, VAS or NRS for each type of typical pain related to endometriosis ([dysmenorrhea](../Page/經痛.md "wikilink"), deep [dyspareunia](../Page/性交疼痛.md "wikilink") and non-menstrual ), combined with the  (CGI) and a [quality of life](../Page/生活质量.md "wikilink") scale, are used.\[145\]

## 預防

有限的證據顯示使用[复合口服避孕药](../Page/复合口服避孕药.md "wikilink")、規律運動，以及避免攝取酒精及咖啡因等，和降低子宮內膜異位症的風險有關\[146\]\[147\]。

## 治療

在生育年齡的女性，子宮內膜異位症的治療目標有：緩解疼痛、限制疾病的惡化和保有生育能力。在較年輕的女性，手術治療方式傾向移除子宮內膜組織並在不傷害正常組織的情況下保留卵巢。大致上來說，子宮內膜異位症是藉由手術在切除或電燒的步驟中取得的組織來診斷。之後的治療程序則是依不同情況而定 : 在沒有不孕的女性可使用抑制疾病進展的賀爾蒙藥物和疼痛治療。而在不孕的女性則預期會在手術後使用不孕症藥物或是人工授精。至於手術電燒灼子宮內膜則會在術後短期有高的復發率。而降低短期復發率最佳的手術方法則是完整的切除(切掉並移除)病灶。

目前沒有治癒子宮內膜異位症的方式，現行的治療大致可分為止痛和治療這兩個大方向\[148\]。許多女性在停經（不論是生理性或手術造成）後狀會減輕\[149\]。 In women in the reproductive years, endometriosis is merely managed: the goal is to provide pain relief, to restrict progression of the process, and to restore or preserve fertility where needed. In younger women, surgical treatment attempts to remove endometrial tissue and preserve the ovaries without damaging normal tissue.\[150\]

In general, the diagnosis of endometriosis is confirmed during surgery, at which time ablative steps can be taken. Further steps depend on circumstances: a woman without infertility can be managed with hormonal medication that suppresses the natural cycle and pain medication, while an infertile woman may be treated expectantly after surgery, with fertility medication, or with [IVF](../Page/體外人工受精.md "wikilink"). As to the surgical procedure, [ablation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/燒蝕 "wikilink") (or ) of endometriosis (burning and vaporizing the lesions with an electric device) has shown a high rate of short-term recurrence after the procedure. The best surgical procedure with much lower rate of short-term recurrence is to excise (cut and remove) the lesions completely.\[151\]

### Surgery

Surgery, if done should generally be laparoscopically (through keyhole surgery) rather than open.\[152\] Treatment consists of the excision of the [endometrium](../Page/子宮內膜.md "wikilink"), [adhesions](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/沾黏 "wikilink"), resection of endometriomas, and restoration of normal pelvic anatomy as much as is possible.\[153\] Endometrioma on the ovary of any significant size (Approx. 2 cm +) —sometimes misdiagnosed as ovarian cysts— must be removed surgically because hormonal treatment alone will not remove the full endometrioma cyst, which can progress to acute pain from the rupturing of the cyst and internal bleeding. , besides being used for diagnosis, can also be used to perform surgery. It's considered a "minimally invasive" surgery because the surgeon makes very small openings (incisions) at (or around) the belly button and lower portion of the belly. A thin telescope-like instrument (the laparoscope) is placed through one incision, which allows the doctor to look for endometriosis using a small camera attached to the laparoscope. Small instruments are inserted through the incisions to remove the endometriosis tissue and adhesions. Because the incisions are very small, there will only be small scars on the skin after the procedure, and all endometriosis can be removed, and women recover from surgery quicker and have a lower risk of adhesions.\[154\]

55% to 100% of women develop adhesions following pelvic surgery,\[155\] which can result in infertility, chronic abdominal and pelvic pain, and difficult reoperative surgery. Trehan's temporary ovarian suspension, a technique in which the ovaries are suspended for a week after surgery may be used to reduce the incidence of adhesions after endometriosis surgery.\[156\]\[157\]

Conservative treatment involves excision of endometriosis while preserving the ovaries and uterus, very important for women wishing to conceive, but may increase the risk of recurrence.\[158\]

Endometriosis recurrence following conservative surgery is estimated as 21.5% at 2 years and 40-50% at 5 years.\[159\]

Historically, a [hysterectomy](../Page/子宮切除術.md "wikilink") (removal of the uterus) was thought to be a cure for endometriosis in women who do not wish to conceive. Removal of the uterus may, in some people, be beneficial as part of the treatment when the uterus itself is affected by adenomyosis. However, this should only be done when combined with removal of the endometriosis by excision, as if endometriosis is not also removed at the time of hysterectomy, pain may persist.\[160\]

For women with extreme pain, a presacral neurectomy may be very rarely performed where the nerves to the uterus are cut. However, this technique is almost never used due to the high incidence of associated complications including presacral hematoma and irreversible problems with urination and constipation.\[161\]

### Hormonal medications

  - therapy: [Birth control pills](../Page/复合口服避孕药.md "wikilink") reduce the menstrual pain associated with endometriosis.\[162\] They may function by reducing or eliminating menstrual flow and providing estrogen support.  is the first-line treatment for most women with endometriosis due to its ability to be used over long periods of time, relative inexpensiveness and ease of use, and additional benefit of reducing ovarian/endometrial cancer risk.\[163\]

  - [Progestogens](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/孕激素 "wikilink"):  counteracts estrogen and inhibits the growth of the endometrium.\[164\] Such therapy can reduce or eliminate menstruation in a controlled and reversible fashion. [Progestins](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/黄体制剂 "wikilink") are chemical variants of natural progesterone. An example of a progestin is  (Visanne). Whilst progestogens are often given as part of a combined hormonal therapy with the addition of estrogen, progestogen-only therapy may be an acceptable alternative.

  - [Danazol](../Page/達那唑.md "wikilink") (Danocrine) and [gestrinone](../Page/孕三烯酮.md "wikilink") (Dimetrose, Nemestran) are suppressive steroids with some androgenic activity.\[165\] Both agents inhibit the growth of endometriosis but their use remains limited as they may cause [masculinizing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/雄性化 "wikilink") side effects such as [excessive hair growth](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/多毛症 "wikilink") and [voice changes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/變聲 "wikilink").

  - s: These drugs include s such as  (Lupron) and s such as  (Orilissa) and are thought to work by decreasing estrogen levels.\[166\] A 2010 Cochrane review found that GnRH modulators were more effective for pain relief in endometriosis than no treatment or [placebo](../Page/安慰劑.md "wikilink"), but were no more effective than danazol or intrauterine progestogen, and had more side effects than danazol.\[167\] A 2018 Swedish systematic review found that GnRH modulators had similar pain-relieving effects to gestagen, but also decreased bone density.\[168\]

  - s are medications that block the formation of estrogen and have become of interest for researchers who are treating endometriosis.\[169\] Examples of aromatase inhibitors include  and . Evidence for aromatase inhibitors is limited due to the limited number and quality of studies available, though show promising benefit in terms of pain control.\[170\]

### Other medication

  - [NSAIDs](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAID "wikilink"): Anti-inflammatory. They are commonly used in conjunction with other therapy. For more severe cases narcotic prescription drugs may be used. NSAID injections can be helpful for severe pain or if stomach pain prevents oral NSAID use. Examples of NSAIDs include [ibuprofen](../Page/布洛芬.md "wikilink") and [naproxen](../Page/萘普生.md "wikilink").

  - [Opioids](../Page/鴉片類藥物.md "wikilink"): [Morphine](../Page/嗎啡.md "wikilink") sulphate tablets and other opioid painkillers work by mimicking the action of naturally occurring pain-reducing chemicals called "[endorphins](../Page/内啡肽.md "wikilink")". There are different long acting and short acting medications that can be used alone or in combination to provide appropriate pain control.

  - Following laparoscopic surgery women who were given Chinese herbs were reported to have comparable benefits to women with conventional drug treatments, though the journal article that reviewed this study also noted that "the two trials included in this review are of poor methodological quality so these findings must be interpreted cautiously. Better quality randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate a possible role for CHM \[Chinese Herbal Medicine\] in the treatment of endometriosis."\[171\]

  - , an immunomodulating agent, has been theorized to improve pain as well as improve pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. A 2012 Cochrane review found that there was not enough evidence to support the effectiveness or safety of either of these uses.\[172\] Current  (ACOG) guidelines do not include immune-modulators, such as pentoxifylline, in standard treatment protocols.\[173\]

  - s lack clinical evidence of efficacy in endometriosis therapy.\[174\] Under experimental *[in vitro](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro "wikilink")* and *[in vivo](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo "wikilink")* conditions, compounds that have been shown to exert inhibitory effects on endometriotic lesions include growth factor inhibitors, endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, fumagillin analogues, [statins](../Page/羟甲基戊二酸单酰辅酶A还原酶抑制剂.md "wikilink"), s, [phytochemical](../Page/植物化學成分.md "wikilink") compounds, [immunomodulators](../Page/免疫治疗.md "wikilink"), s, s, [progestins](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/黄体制剂 "wikilink"), [danazol](../Page/達那唑.md "wikilink") and [gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_agonist "wikilink").\[175\] However, many of these agents are associated with undesirable side effects and more research is necessary. An ideal therapy would diminish inflammation and underlying symptoms without being contraceptive.\[176\]\[177\]

The overall effectiveness of manual physical therapy to treat endometriosis has not yet been identified.\[178\]

### Comparison of interventions

Medicinal and surgical interventions produce roughly equivalent pain-relief benefits. Recurrence of pain was found to be 44 and 53 percent with medicinal and surgical interventions, respectively.\[179\] Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.\[180\] Manual therapy showed a decrease in pain for 84 percent of study participants, and a 93 percent improvement in sexual function.\[181\]

evidence on how effective medication is for relieving pain associated with endometriosis was limited .\[182\] A 2018 Swedish systematic review found a large number of studies but a general lack of scientific evidence for most treatments.\[183\] There was only one study of sufficient quality and relevance comparing the effect of surgery and non-surgery.\[184\] Cohort studies indicate that surgery is effective in decreasing pain.\[185\] Most complications occurred in cases of low intestinal anastomosis, while risk of fistula occurred in cases of combined abdominal or vaginal surgery, and urinary tract problems were common in intestinal surgery.\[186\] The evidence was found to be insufficient regarding surgical intervention.\[187\]

The advantages of surgery are demonstrated efficacy for pain control,\[188\] it is more effective for infertility than medicinal intervention,\[189\] it provides a definitive diagnosis,\[190\] and surgery can often be performed as a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure to reduce morbidity and minimize the risk of post-operative adhesions.\[191\] Efforts to develop effective strategies to reduce or prevent adhesions have been undertaken, but their formation remain a frequent side effect of abdominal surgery.\[192\]

The advantages of physical therapy techniques are decreased cost, absence of major side-effects, it does not interfere with fertility, and near-universal increase of sexual function.\[193\] Disadvantages are that there are no large or long-term studies of its use for treating pain or infertility related to endometriosis.\[194\]

### Treatment of infertility

Surgery is more effective than medicinal intervention for addressing infertility associated with endometriosis.\[195\] Surgery attempts to remove endometrial tissue and preserve the ovaries without damaging normal tissue.\[196\] [In-vitro fertilization](../Page/體外人工受精.md "wikilink") (IVF) procedures are effective in improving fertility in many women with endometriosis.\[197\]

During fertility treatment, the ultralong pretreatment with GnRH-agonist has a higher chance of resulting in pregnancy for women with endometriosis, compared to the short pretreatment.\[198\]

## Outcomes

Proper counseling of women with endometriosis requires attention to several aspects of the disorder. Of primary importance is the initial operative staging of the disease to obtain adequate information on which to base future decisions about therapy. The woman's symptoms and desire for childbearing dictate appropriate therapy. Not all therapy works for all women. Some women have recurrences after surgery or pseudo-menopause. In most cases, treatment will give women significant relief from pelvic pain and assist them in achieving pregnancy.\[199\]

The underlying process that causes endometriosis may not cease after a surgical or medical intervention. Studies have shown that endometriosis recurs at a rate of 20 to 40 percent within five years following conservative surgery.\[200\] Monitoring of women consists of periodic clinical examinations and [sonography](../Page/医学超声检查.md "wikilink").

### Complications

Complications of endometriosis include internal scarring, [adhesions](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/沾黏 "wikilink"), pelvic cysts, [chocolate cysts of ovaries](../Page/子宮內膜異位瘤.md "wikilink"), ruptured cysts, and bowel and ureter obstruction resulting from pelvic adhesions.\[201\]  can be related to scar formation and anatomical distortions due to the endometriosis.\[202\]

Ovarian endometriosis may complicate pregnancy by , abscess and/or rupture.\[203\]

is associated with recurrent pneumothoraces at times of a menstrual period, termed .\[204\]

A 20-year study of 12,000 women with endometriosis found that women under 40 who are diagnosed with endometriosis are 3 times more likely to have heart problems than their healthy peers.\[205\]\[206\]

It results in few deaths.\[207\]

## Epidemiology

Determining how many people have endometriosis is challenging because definitive diagnosis requires surgical visualization.\[208\] Criteria that are commonly used to establish a diagnosis include pelvic pain, infertility, surgical assessment, and in some cases, magnetic resonance imaging. These studies suggest that endometriosis affects approximately 11% of women in the general population.\[209\] It may affect more than 11% of American women between 15 and 44.\[210\] Endometriosis is most common in those in their thirties and forties; however, it can begin in girls as early as 8 years old.\[211\]\[212\]

It can affect any female, from [premenarche](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/初潮 "wikilink") to [postmenopause](../Page/更年期.md "wikilink"), regardless of race or ethnicity or whether or not they have had children. It is primarily a disease of the reproductive years.\[213\] Incidences of endometriosis have occurred in postmenopausal women,\[214\] and in less common cases, girls may have endometriosis symptoms before they even reach menarche.\[215\]\[216\]

The rate of recurrence of endometriosis is estimated to be 40-50% for adults over a 5-year period.\[217\] The rate of recurrence has been shown to increase with time from surgery and is not associated with the stage of the disease, initial site, surgical method used, or post-surgical treatment.\[218\]

## History

Endometriosis was first discovered microscopically by [Karl von Rokitansky](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/卡尔·冯·罗基坦斯基 "wikilink") in 1860,\[219\] although it was documented in medical texts more than 4,000 years ago.\[220\] The  outlines symptoms similar to endometriosis, including uterine ulcers, adhesions, and infertility.\[221\] Historically, women with these symptoms were treated with [leeches](../Page/蚂蟥.md "wikilink"), [straitjackets](../Page/拘束衣.md "wikilink"), [bloodletting](../Page/放血.md "wikilink"), chemical [douches](../Page/清洗_\(醫學\).md "wikilink"), [genital mutilation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/残割女性生殖器 "wikilink"), [pregnancy](../Page/妊娠.md "wikilink") (as a form of treatment), hanging upside down, surgical intervention, and even killing due to suspicion of .\[222\] Hippocratic doctors recognized and treated chronic pelvic pain as a true organic disorder 2,500 years ago, but during the Middle Ages, there was a shift into believing that women with pelvic pain were mad, immoral, imagining the pain, or simply misbehaving.\[223\] The symptoms of inexplicable chronic pelvic pain were often attributed to imagined madness, female weakness, promiscuity, or hysteria.\[224\] The historical diagnosis of hysteria, which was thought to be a psychological disease, may have indeed been endometriosis.\[225\] The idea that chronic pelvic pain was related to mental illness influenced modern attitudes regarding women with endometriosis, leading to delays in correct diagnosis and indifference to the patients' true pain during the 20th century.\[226\]

Hippocratic doctors believed that delaying childbearing could trigger diseases of the uterus, which caused endometriosis-like symptoms. Women with dysmenorrhea were encouraged to marry and have children at a young age.\[227\] The fact that Hippocratics were recommending changes in marriage practices due to an endometriosis-like illness implies that this disease was likely common, with rates higher than the 5-15% prevalence that is often cited today.\[228\] If indeed this disorder was so common historically, this may point away from modern theories that suggest links between endometriosis and dioxins, PCBs, and chemicals.\[229\]

## Society and culture

There are public figures who speak out about their experience with endometriosis including [Whoopi Goldberg](../Page/琥碧·戈柏.md "wikilink"), , and [Julianne Hough](../Page/茱莉安·哈克.md "wikilink").\[230\]\[231\]\[232\]

The economic burden of endometriosis is widespread and multifaceted.\[233\] Endometriosis is a chronic disease that has direct and indirect costs which include loss of work days, direct costs of treatment, symptom management, and treatment of other associated conditions such as depression or chronic pain.\[234\] One factor which seems to be associated with especially high costs is the delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. Costs vary greatly between countries.\[235\]

As recently as 1995, reports found that over 50% of women with chronic pelvic pain had no organic cause, with women still often being considered mentally unstable.\[236\] Self-help groups say practitioners delay making the diagnosis, often because they do not consider it a possibility. In the US, as of 2007, about 27% of women with endometriosis had had the symptoms for at least six years before it is diagnosed.\[237\]

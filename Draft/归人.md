The **Kuy** (, ) are an indigenous [ethnic group](../Page/族群.md "wikilink") of mainland [Southeast Asia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/东南亚 "wikilink"). The native lands of the Kuy range from the southern [Khorat Plateau](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/呵叻高原 "wikilink") in [northeast Thailand](../Page/依善地区.md "wikilink") east to the banks of the [Mekong River](../Page/湄公河.md "wikilink") in southern [Laos](../Page/老挝.md "wikilink") and south to north central [Cambodia](../Page/柬埔寨.md "wikilink").\[1\] The Kuy are an ethnic minority in all three countries, where they live as  or [Montagnards](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/高地高棉人 "wikilink"). Their language is classified as a  of the [Mon-Khmer](../Page/南亚语系.md "wikilink") language family and, as such, is related to the [Khmer language](../Page/高棉语.md "wikilink") of Cambodia. The Thais, Lao, and Khmer traditionally recognize the Kuy as the aboriginal inhabitants of the region and refer to them as *Khmer boran* (Khmer), meaning "ancient Khmer" or *Khamen pa dong* (; , "jungle Khmer people"). The word *kuy* in the  means "people" or "human being"; alternate English spellings include Kui, Kuoy and Kuay, while forms similar to "Suay" or "Suei" are derived from the Thai/Lao [exonyms](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:exonym "wikilink") meaning "those who pay tribute".\[2\] The Kuy are known as skilled s, or elephant trainers, and many Kuy villages are employed in finding, taming, and selling elephants.\[3\]

## Geographic distribution

The Kuy are found in a region of mainland Southeast Asia roughly between the [Dangrek Mountains](../Page/扁擔山脈.md "wikilink") and the , straddling the borders where Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos meet.\[4\] The majority, over 80 percent, live in Thailand in the provinces of [Surin](../Page/素林府.md "wikilink"), [Buriram](../Page/武里南府.md "wikilink"), [Sisaket](../Page/四色菊府.md "wikilink"), and [Ubon Ratchathani](../Page/烏汶府.md "wikilink"). From Ubon Ratchathani, their range continues over the Lao border where another 43,000 live in [Savannakhet](../Page/沙湾拿吉省.md "wikilink"), [Salavan](../Page/沙拉湾省.md "wikilink") and [Champasak](../Page/占巴塞省.md "wikilink") provinces along both banks of the Mekong. Across the Cambodian border, approximately 38,000 Kuy live in mainly in [Preah Vihear](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/柏威夏省 "wikilink"), [Steung Treng](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/上丁省 "wikilink") and northern [Kampong Thom](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/磅同省 "wikilink") with a small population in [Kratie](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/桔井省 "wikilink").\[5\] In Cambodia and Laos, Kuy are considered a "hill tribe" and, especially in Laos, many live in more isolated areas in separate villages and have not integrated into mainstream society. In Cambodia, where significant numbers of Kuy also live among the Khmer, they are considered a [Khmer Loeu](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Loeu "wikilink") group while in Laos there are counted among the [Lao Theung](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/老聽族 "wikilink") ("midland Lao"). In Thailand, most Kuy are more socially integrated and often live in mixed villages alongside the [Northern Khmer](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/北高棉人 "wikilink").

## Culture

Traditional Kuy culture is similar to other Mon-Khmer minority groups of Southeast Asia. Historically, they were subsistence farmers and supplemented this by weaving, raising livestock, and fishing. During times of drought or when the soil lost its fertility, whole villages relocated to more favorable land. Veneration of spirits, known by the Lao term *satsana phi*, was the primary religious or cosmological belief. In addition to ancestor spirits, Kuy believe in other nature spirits including that of the [monitor lizard](../Page/巨蜥.md "wikilink") (*takuat*) which they believe to be symbol of fertility. The Kuy perform ceremonies to propitiate the *takuat* spirit and ask for fertility from nature. They would also take the tail of the lizard to use in divination ceremonies. Those of ill health would perform a ceremony called *kael mo* for healing.\[6\] Those Kuy who raise and train elephants venerate their own set of spirits related to their work.\[7\]

Modern Kuy, however are influenced by the dominant culture of the country in which they live. Most Kuy in Thailand, for example, where 20th century [Thaification](../Page/泰化.md "wikilink") policies outlawed spirit worship, have adopted the local form of [Theravada Buddhism](../Page/上座部佛教.md "wikilink") and use [Isan Thai](../Page/依善語.md "wikilink") as an alternate first language.\[8\] Seventy-four percent of the Kuy in Cambodia are no longer fluent in Kuy, having adopted Khmer for daily use,\[9\] and many have all but integrated into Khmer society although a significant portion still participate in traditional Kuy spiritual activities alongside Khmer Buddhism.

Women have an esteemed position in Kui society ensuring community cohesion and spiritual beliefs, apart from their central role in subsistence food production.\[10\]

### Language

As with other aspects of Kuy culture, language use varies based on country of residence. The Kuy in Thailand have been subject to [Thaification](../Page/泰化.md "wikilink") policies in the past and, while maintaining positive views about their native language (), most often use the local [Lao dialect](../Page/依善語.md "wikilink"). Thai Kuy are also fluent in [Central Thai](../Page/泰语.md "wikilink") and 40 percent also use [Northern Khmer](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/北部高棉语 "wikilink"). In Laos, which has the largest population of Kuy monolinguals, approximately 80 percent speak only Kuy. The remaining Kuy of Laos also use [Lao](../Page/老挝语.md "wikilink"). Only 26 percent of the Kuy in Cambodia reported being able to communicate in the Kuy language with the remainder speaking only Khmer.\[11\] The Kuy language has no alphabet of its own. Kuy is written in [Thai script](../Page/泰文字.md "wikilink") in Thailand, [Khmer script](../Page/高棉文.md "wikilink") in Cambodia, and [Lao script](../Page/老撾文.md "wikilink") in Laos.

The Kuy language belongs to the [Austroasiatic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austroasiatic_languages "wikilink") language family, within which several more closely related languages, including [Bru](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/布鲁语 "wikilink"), , and Kuy, among others, make up the  subgroup. Kuy accounts for the largest group of Katuic speakers with a recent estimates placing their numbers at 800,000, double the more conservative traditionally accepted estimates.\[12\] Separated by distance, geographical features and political borders, Kuy speakers' speech has evolved into several marked, but mutually intelligible, [dialects](../Page/方言.md "wikilink"). In Thailand, two major dialects have been recognized, each of which can be further divided into sub-dialects.\[13\] Cambodian Kuy has been described as having four distinct dialects,\[14\] while the political situation in Laos has made study of Kuy dialects there difficult.

### Subgroups

Research of the late-19th to early-20th century reported that the Kuy of the time were "vaguely aware" of different clans or tribes within Kuy society, but even by that time consciousness of these divisions was waning.\[15\] A 1988 study found that modern Kuy were no longer conscious of any clan or tribal affiliation and, among themselves, only recognized differences in dialect and national origin.\[16\] One exception were the approximately 200\[17\] *Kuy Nheu* (*ɲə*), found in the ,  and  districts of Srisaket, who were "very conscious of the fact that they were different from all other Kui".\[18\]

### Kuy in Cambodia

The Kuy people are actively engaged in efforts to preserve  forest in Cambodia.\[19\]\[20\] Prey Lang's name originated from the  and means "the forest (Prey) which belongs to all of us".\[21\] Organisations including [Amnesty International](../Page/國際特赦組織.md "wikilink") and  have documented how Kuy people have faced  and been forcefully evicted from their homes due to economic land concessions.\[22\]\[23\]\[24\]

The "spirit forest" is an integral part of Kuy culture, however spirit forests are increasingly impacted by [mining](../Page/采矿业.md "wikilink") interests as Cambodia develops.\[25\] Some Kuy people are [artisans](../Page/手工藝人.md "wikilink") with unique [basket](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/籃 "wikilink") and [textile](../Page/布.md "wikilink") [weaving](../Page/梭织.md "wikilink") skills.\[26\] Some Kuy are [rice](../Page/稻.md "wikilink") farmers or raise [silk worms](../Page/蚕.md "wikilink") and weave [silk](../Page/丝绸.md "wikilink").\[27\]

The Cambodian Indigenous Youth Association has members who are Kuy people who study and work in [Phnom Penh](../Page/金边.md "wikilink").

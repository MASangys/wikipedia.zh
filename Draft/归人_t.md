**归人**（**Kuy**, , ）是分布于[中南半岛的一个土著](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中南半岛 "wikilink")[族群](../Page/族群.md "wikilink")。 他们的祖居地西起泰国[依善地区](../Page/依善地区.md "wikilink")[呵叻高原](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/呵叻高原 "wikilink")，东至老挝南部的湄公河两岸，南到柬埔寨中北部。\[1\]归人在这三个国家均为少数民族。被视为或[高地高棉人](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/高地高棉人 "wikilink")。

归人的母语为桂语，系属于南亞语系的。 泰国人、老挝人和高棉人传统上承认 Kuy 人是该地区的土著居民，称他们为高棉人 boran (高棉人) ，意思是“古代高棉人”或 Khamen pa dong (something something: something something something something something something something something something something something something; 模板: Rtgs，“丛林高棉人”)。

Kuy 在桂语中的意思是“人”，英语的其他拼法包括 Kui、 Kuoy 和 Kuay，而类似于“ Suay”或“ Suei”的形式则来自泰语 / 老挝语外来语地名，意思是“致敬的人”。 归人以擅长驯象而闻名

Their language is classified as a  of the [南亚语系](../Page/南亚语系.md "wikilink") language family and, as such, is related to the [高棉语](../Page/高棉语.md "wikilink") of Cambodia. The Thais, Lao, and Khmer traditionally recognize the Kuy as the aboriginal inhabitants of the region and refer to them as *Khmer boran* (Khmer), meaning "ancient Khmer" or *Khamen pa dong* (; , "jungle Khmer people"). The word *kuy* in the  means "people" or "human being"; alternate English spellings include Kui, Kuoy and Kuay, while forms similar to "Suay" or "Suei" are derived from the Thai/Lao [exonyms](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:exonym "wikilink") meaning "those who pay tribute".\[2\] The Kuy are known as skilled s, or elephant trainers, and many Kuy villages are employed in finding, taming, and selling elephants.\[3\]

## Geographic distribution

The Kuy are found in a region of mainland Southeast Asia roughly between the [扁擔山脈](../Page/扁擔山脈.md "wikilink") and the , straddling the borders where Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos meet.\[4\] The majority, over 80 percent, live in Thailand in the provinces of [素林府](../Page/素林府.md "wikilink"), [武里南府](../Page/武里南府.md "wikilink"), [四色菊府](../Page/四色菊府.md "wikilink"), and [烏汶府](../Page/烏汶府.md "wikilink"). From Ubon Ratchathani, their range continues over the Lao border where another 43,000 live in [沙湾拿吉省](../Page/沙湾拿吉省.md "wikilink"), [沙拉湾省](../Page/沙拉湾省.md "wikilink") and [占巴塞省](../Page/占巴塞省.md "wikilink") provinces along both banks of the Mekong. Across the Cambodian border, approximately 38,000 Kuy live in mainly in [柏威夏省](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/柏威夏省 "wikilink"), [上丁省](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/上丁省 "wikilink") and northern [磅同省](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/磅同省 "wikilink") with a small population in [桔井省](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/桔井省 "wikilink").\[5\] In Cambodia and Laos, Kuy are considered a "hill tribe" and, especially in Laos, many live in more isolated areas in separate villages and have not integrated into mainstream society. In Cambodia, where significant numbers of Kuy also live among the Khmer, they are considered a [Khmer Loeu](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Loeu "wikilink") group while in Laos there are counted among the [老聽族](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/老聽族 "wikilink") ("midland Lao"). In Thailand, most Kuy are more socially integrated and often live in mixed villages alongside the [北高棉人](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/北高棉人 "wikilink").

## 文化

Traditional Kuy culture is similar to other Mon-Khmer minority groups of Southeast Asia. Historically, they were subsistence farmers and supplemented this by weaving, raising livestock, and fishing. During times of drought or when the soil lost its fertility, whole villages relocated to more favorable land. Veneration of spirits, known by the Lao term *satsana phi*, was the primary religious or cosmological belief. In addition to ancestor spirits, Kuy believe in other nature spirits including that of the [巨蜥](../Page/巨蜥.md "wikilink") (*takuat*) which they believe to be symbol of fertility. The Kuy perform ceremonies to propitiate the *takuat* spirit and ask for fertility from nature. They would also take the tail of the lizard to use in divination ceremonies. Those of ill health would perform a ceremony called *kael mo* for healing.\[6\] Those Kuy who raise and train elephants venerate their own set of spirits related to their work.\[7\]

Modern Kuy, however are influenced by the dominant culture of the country in which they live. Most Kuy in Thailand, for example, where 20th century [泰化](../Page/泰化.md "wikilink") policies outlawed spirit worship, have adopted the local form of [上座部佛教](../Page/上座部佛教.md "wikilink") and use [依善語](../Page/依善語.md "wikilink") as an alternate first language.\[8\] Seventy-four percent of the Kuy in Cambodia are no longer fluent in Kuy, having adopted Khmer for daily use,\[9\] and many have all but integrated into Khmer society although a significant portion still participate in traditional Kuy spiritual activities alongside Khmer Buddhism.

Women have an esteemed position in Kui society ensuring community cohesion and spiritual beliefs, apart from their central role in subsistence food production.\[10\]

### 语言

As with other aspects of Kuy culture, language use varies based on country of residence. The Kuy in Thailand have been subject to [泰化](../Page/泰化.md "wikilink") policies in the past and, while maintaining positive views about their native language (), most often use the local [依善語](../Page/依善語.md "wikilink"). Thai Kuy are also fluent in [泰语](../Page/泰语.md "wikilink") and 40 percent also use [北部高棉语](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/北部高棉语 "wikilink"). In Laos, which has the largest population of Kuy monolinguals, approximately 80 percent speak only Kuy. The remaining Kuy of Laos also use [老挝语](../Page/老挝语.md "wikilink"). Only 26 percent of the Kuy in Cambodia reported being able to communicate in the Kuy language with the remainder speaking only Khmer.\[11\] The Kuy language has no alphabet of its own. Kuy is written in [泰文字](../Page/泰文字.md "wikilink") in Thailand, [高棉文](../Page/高棉文.md "wikilink") in Cambodia, and [老撾文](../Page/老撾文.md "wikilink") in Laos.

The Kuy language belongs to the [Austroasiatic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austroasiatic_languages "wikilink") language family, within which several more closely related languages, including [布鲁语](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/布鲁语 "wikilink"), , and Kuy, among others, make up the  subgroup. Kuy accounts for the largest group of Katuic speakers with a recent estimates placing their numbers at 800,000, double the more conservative traditionally accepted estimates.\[12\] Separated by distance, geographical features and political borders, Kuy speakers' speech has evolved into several marked, but mutually intelligible, [方言](../Page/方言.md "wikilink"). In Thailand, two major dialects have been recognized, each of which can be further divided into sub-dialects.\[13\] Cambodian Kuy has been described as having four distinct dialects,\[14\] while the political situation in Laos has made study of Kuy dialects there difficult.

### 分支

Research of the late-19th to early-20th century reported that the Kuy of the time were "vaguely aware" of different clans or tribes within Kuy society, but even by that time consciousness of these divisions was waning.\[15\] A 1988 study found that modern Kuy were no longer conscious of any clan or tribal affiliation and, among themselves, only recognized differences in dialect and national origin.\[16\] One exception were the approximately 200\[17\] *Kuy Nheu* (*ɲə*), found in the ,  and  districts of Srisaket, who were "very conscious of the fact that they were different from all other Kui".\[18\]

### 柬埔寨归人

The Kuy people are actively engaged in efforts to preserve  forest in Cambodia.\[19\]\[20\] Prey Lang's name originated from the  and means "the forest (Prey) which belongs to all of us".\[21\] Organisations including [國際特赦組織](../Page/國際特赦組織.md "wikilink") and  have documented how Kuy people have faced  and been forcefully evicted from their homes due to economic land concessions.\[22\]\[23\]\[24\]

The "spirit forest" is an integral part of Kuy culture, however spirit forests are increasingly impacted by [采矿业](../Page/采矿业.md "wikilink") interests as Cambodia develops.\[25\] Some Kuy people are [手工藝人](../Page/手工藝人.md "wikilink") with unique [籃](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/籃 "wikilink") and [布](../Page/布.md "wikilink") [梭织](../Page/梭织.md "wikilink") skills.\[26\] Some Kuy are [稻](../Page/稻.md "wikilink") farmers or raise [蚕](../Page/蚕.md "wikilink") and weave [丝绸](../Page/丝绸.md "wikilink").\[27\]

The Cambodian Indigenous Youth Association has members who are Kuy people who study and work in [金边](../Page/金边.md "wikilink").

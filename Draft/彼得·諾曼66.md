### 1968年夏季奧林匹克運動會

[John_Carlos,_Tommie_Smith,_Peter_Norman_1968cr.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Carlos,_Tommie_Smith,_Peter_Norman_1968cr.jpg "fig:John_Carlos,_Tommie_Smith,_Peter_Norman_1968cr.jpg") The 200 metres event at the [1968 Olympics](../Page/1968年夏季奥林匹克运动会.md "wikilink") started on 15 October and finished on 16 October; Norman won his heat in a time of 20.17 seconds, which was briefly an Olympic record. He won his quarter-final and was second in the semi-final.

On the morning of 16 October, US athlete Tommie Smith won the 200-metre final with a world-record time of 19.83 seconds. Norman finished second in a time of 20.06 s, after catching and eventually passing U.S. athlete John Carlos at the finish line. Carlos finished in third place in 20.10 s. Norman's time was his all-time personal best\[7\] and an Australian record that still stands.

[1968年夏季奧林匹克運動會的](../Page/1968年夏季奥林匹克运动会.md "wikilink")200公尺賽事開始於該年10月15日並結束於10月16日，諾曼以20.17秒贏得四分之一決賽與決賽的銀牌，以及短暫的[奧運會紀錄](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/奥运会纪录 "wikilink")。\[8\]10月16日上午，美國運動員以19.83秒的世界紀錄贏得200公尺冠軍\[9\]\[10\]，諾曼則在終點線超越卡洛斯後以20.06秒得到亞軍，最後由美國運動員以20.10秒位居季軍。此次的200公尺秒數為諾曼歷年個人賽中最佳賽績，且至今仍是澳洲紀錄。

After the race, the three athletes went to the medal podium for their medals to be presented by David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter. On the podium, during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner", Smith and Carlos famously joined in a Black Power salute. This salute was later described in Tommie Smith's autobiography as a Human Rights salute, not a Black Power salute.

賽程結束後，三名運動員前往頒獎典禮並由頒發獎牌。當典禮現場撥放美國國歌《[星條旗](../Page/星条旗_\(美国国歌\).md "wikilink")》時，史密斯和卡洛斯帶上黑色手套向[黑人權力致敬](../Page/黑人权力.md "wikilink")。托米·史密斯後來在自傳裡描述此事件為向[人權致敬](../Page/人权.md "wikilink")，而非向黑人權力致敬。

Norman wore a badge on the podium in support of the 下面 . After the final, Carlos and Smith had told Norman what they were planning to do during the ceremony.

諾曼在頒獎典禮別上徽章以表支持（OPHR）。賽程結束後，史密斯和卡洛斯告訴諾曼他們接著在典禮上的計畫。

As journalist 下面 wrote: "They asked Norman if he believed in human rights. He said he did. They asked him if he believed in God. Norman, who came from a Salvation Army background, said he believed strongly in God. We knew that what we were going to do was far greater than any athletic feat. He said, 'I'll stand with you'. Carlos said he expected to see fear in Norman's eyes. He didn't; 'I saw love.'"

根據記者所寫：「史密斯和卡洛斯問諾曼是否相信人權，他說相信。他們又問諾曼是否相信上帝，生長於救世軍家庭的諾曼說自己對上帝深信不疑，我們都知道自己將要做的事遠超過於任何運動員的英勇事蹟。諾曼說：『我將與你們同在』，卡洛斯說他以為會在諾曼眼中看見恐懼，但並沒有，他說：『我看見愛』。」\[11\]

***On the way to*** the medal ceremony, Norman saw the OPHR badge being worn by , a white member of the US Rowing Team, and asked him if he could wear it.\[12\] It was Norman who suggested that Smith and Carlos share the black gloves used in their salute, after Carlos left his pair at the Olympic Village.\[13\] This is the reason for Smith raising his right fist, while Carlos raised his left.

### Later career

Before the 1968 Olympics, Norman was a trainer for  [Australian rules football](../Page/澳式足球.md "wikilink") club as a way of keeping fit over winter during the athletic circuit's off season. After 1968 he played 67 games for West Brunswick from 1972 to 1977 before coaching an under 19 team in 1978.

In 1985, Norman contracted [gangrene](../Page/坏疽.md "wikilink") after tearing his [Achilles tendon](../Page/跟腱.md "wikilink") during a charity race, which nearly led to his leg being amputated. Depression, heavy drinking and pain killer addiction followed.\[14\]

### Treatment after 1968

After the salute, it has been claimed that Norman's career suffered greatly. A 2012 CNN profile said that "he returned home to Australia a pariah, suffering unofficial sanction and ridicule as the Black Power salute's forgotten man. He never ran in the Olympics again."\[15\] He was not selected for the [Olympic Games in Munich](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics "wikilink") in 1972 despite turning in adequate times, and was not welcomed even three decades later at the [2000 Summer Olympics](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics "wikilink") in Sydney.\[16\]\[17\]\[18\] Carlos later stated that "If we \[Carlos and Smith\] were getting beat up, Peter was facing an entire country and suffering alone."\[19\]\[20\]

The [Australian Olympic Committee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/澳大利亞奧林匹克委員會 "wikilink") maintains that Norman was not selected for the 1972 Olympics because he did not meet the selection standard which entailed an athlete equalling or bettering the Olympic qualifying standard (20.9)\[21\] and performing creditably at the .\[22\] Norman ran several qualifying times from 1969-1971\[23\] but he finished third in the 1972  behind  and  in a time of 21.6.\[24\]

Contemporary reports show mixed opinion on whether Norman should have been sent to the Munich Olympics. After coming third in the trials, Norman commented: "All I had to do was to win, even in a slow time, and I think I would have been off to Munich".\[25\] [The Age](../Page/世纪报.md "wikilink") correspondent wrote Norman "probably ran himself out of the team at the National titles"; but also noted he was injured; and continued, "If the selectors do the right thing, Norman should still be on the plane to Munich."\[26\] On the other hand, *Australasian Amateur Athletics*' magazine stated "The dilemma for selectors here was how could they select Norman and not Lewis. Pity that Peter did not win because that would have been the only requirement for a Munich ticket".\[27\]

#### Controversy over claims of ill-treatment

The [Australian Olympic Committee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/澳大利亞奧林匹克委員會 "wikilink") and others have disputed the claims made about Norman being ostracised for supporting Carlos and Smith. The AOC made the following comments:

  - Norman was not punished by the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC).\[28\] He was cautioned by   on the evening of the medal ceremony and then given as many tickets as he wanted to go and watch a hockey match.\[29\]
  - Norman was not selected for the [1972 Munich Olympics](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972年夏季奥林匹克运动会 "wikilink"), as he did not meet the selection standard which entailed an athlete equalling or bettering the Olympic qualifying standard (20.9)\[30\] and performing creditably at the .\[31\] Norman ran several qualifying times from 1969-1971\[32\] but he finished third in the 1972  behind  and  in a time of 21.6.\[33\]

<!-- end list -->

  - In the lead-up to the [2000 Sydney Olympics](../Page/2000年夏季奥林匹克运动会.md "wikilink"), the AOC stated "Norman was involved in numerous Olympic events in his home city of Melbourne. He announced several teams for the AOC in Melbourne and was on the stage in his Mexico 1968 blazer congratulating athletes. He was acknowledged as an Olympian and the AOC valued his contribution."\[34\] Due to cost considerations, the AOC did not have the resources to bring all Australian Olympians to Sydney, and Norman was offered the same chance to buy tickets as other Australian Olympians. The AOC did not believe that Norman was owed an apology.\[35\]

It has been stated that United States authorities invited him to participate in the 2000 Sydney Olympics after they found out he was not attending.\[36\] On 17 October 2003, [San Jose State University](../Page/聖荷西州立大學.md "wikilink") unveiled a statue commemorating the 1968 Olympic protest; Norman was not included as part of the statue itself – his empty podium spot intended for others viewing the statue to "take a stand" – but was invited to deliver a speech at the ceremony.\[37\]

#### 2012 parliamentary apology

In August 2012, the [Australian House of Representatives](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/澳大利亚众议院 "wikilink") debated a motion to provide a posthumous apology to Norman.\[38\]\[39\]\[40\] The chamber passed an official apology motion on 11 October 2012, which read:\[41\]

In a 2012 interview, Carlos said:\[42\]

### Death

Norman died of a [heart attack](../Page/心肌梗死.md "wikilink") on 3 October 2006 in [Melbourne](../Page/墨尔本.md "wikilink") at the age of 64.\[43\] The  proclaimed 9 October 2006, the date of his funeral, as Peter Norman Day. Thirty-eight years after the three made history, both Smith and Carlos gave  and were [pallbearers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/護柩人員 "wikilink") at Norman's funeral.\[44\] At the time of his death, Norman was survived by his second wife, Jan, and their daughters Belinda and Emma, his first wife, Ruth, and children Gary, Sandra and Janita and four grandchildren.\[45\]

## Legacy

Norman's nephew  directed and produced a cinema-released documentary, *[Salute](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salute_\(2008_film\) "wikilink")* (2008), about the three runners, which was released by [Paramount Pictures](../Page/派拉蒙影業.md "wikilink") and Transmission Films. Paul Byrnes, in his *[Sydney Morning Herald](../Page/雪梨晨鋒報.md "wikilink")* review of *Salute*, said that the documentary makes it clear why Norman stood with the other two athletes. Byrnes writes, "He was a devout Christian, raised in the Salvation Army \[and\] believed passionately in equality for all, regardless of colour, creed or religion—the Olympic code".\[48\] In October 2018, Matt Norman with the help of journalist Andrew Webster released his uncle's official biography *The Peter Norman Story*.

An airbrush mural of the trio on podium was painted in 2000 in the inner-city suburb of [Newtown](../Page/新镇_\(新南威尔士\).md "wikilink") in Sydney.{{\#tag:ref|39 Pine Street, Newtown, New South Wales, Australia|group="A"}} Silvio Offria, who allowed an artist known only as "Donald" to paint the mural on his house in Leamington Lane, said that Norman came to see the mural, "He came and had his photo taken, he was very happy."\[49\] The monochrome tribute, captioned "<small>THREE PROUD PEOPLE MEXICO 68</small>", was under threat of demolition in 2010 to make way for a rail tunnel\[50\] but is now listed as an item of heritage significance.\[51\]

### Recognition

  - 1999 –  inductee
  - 2000 – [Australian Sports Medal](../Page/澳大利亚体育奖章.md "wikilink")
  - 2010 –  Hall of Fame inductee
  - 2018 – Order of Merit from Australian Olympic Committee \[52\]
  - 2018 -  in partnership with the Victorian Government announced the building and erecting a bronze statue of Norman at Lakeside Stadium in Melbourne. The statue will honour Norman’s legacy as an athlete and advocate for human rights.\[53\]

**淺綠環境主義**是一種基於[技术革新](../Page/技术革新.md "wikilink") 觀點的思想對於[永續發展的最佳方式](../Page/可持续发展.md "wikilink")。

## 起源和發展

淺綠環境主義的思想潮是由 The term *bright green*, coined in 2003 by writer , refers to the fast-growing new wing of [environmentalism](../Page/环境保护主义.md "wikilink"), distinct from traditional forms.\[1\]\[2\] Bright green environmentalism aims to provide prosperity in an ecologically sustainable way through the use of new technologies and improved design.\[3\]

Proponents promote and advocate for [green energy](../Page/可持續能源.md "wikilink"), [electric automobiles](../Page/电动车.md "wikilink"), efficient manufacturing systems, [bio](../Page/生物技术.md "wikilink") and [nanotechnologies](../Page/纳米技术.md "wikilink"), [ubiquitous computing](../Page/普适计算.md "wikilink"), [dense urban settlements](../Page/新都市主義.md "wikilink"), [closed loop](../Page/循環經濟.md "wikilink") materials cycles and sustainable product designs. *One-planet living* is a commonly used phrase.\[4\]\[5\] Their principal focus is on the idea that through a combination of well-built communities, new technologies and sustainable living practices, quality of life can actually be improved even while ecological footprints shrink.

The term *bright green* has been used with increased frequency due to the promulgation of these ideas through the Internet and recent coverage in the traditional media.\[6\]\[7\]\[8\]

## Dark greens, light greens and bright greens

describes contemporary s as being split into three groups, *dark*, *light*, and *bright* greens.\[9\] [Colors_of_green.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Colors_of_green.png "fig:Colors_of_green.png")

*Light greens* see protecting the environment first and foremost as a personal responsibility. They fall in on the [transformational activist](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/行动主义 "wikilink") end of the spectrum, but light greens do not emphasize environmentalism as a distinct political ideology, or even seek fundamental [political reform](../Page/改良主义.md "wikilink"). Instead they often focus on environmentalism as a [lifestyle](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/生活型態 "wikilink") choice.\[10\] The motto "Green is the new black" sums up this way of thinking, for many.\[11\] This is different from the term *lite green*, which some environmentalists use to describe products or practices they believe are [greenwashing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/漂綠 "wikilink").

In contrast, *dark greens* believe that environmental problems are an inherent part of industrialized civilization, and seek . Dark greens believe that currently and historically dominant political ideologies (sometimes referred to as [industrialism](../Page/第一次工业革命.md "wikilink")) inevitably lead to [consumerism](../Page/消費主義.md "wikilink"), [overconsumption](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/過度消耗 "wikilink"), [waste](../Page/垃圾.md "wikilink"), [alienation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/社會異化 "wikilink") from nature and [resource depletion](../Page/资源枯竭.md "wikilink"). Dark greens claim this is caused by the emphasis on [economic growth](../Page/经济增长.md "wikilink") that exists within all existing ideologies, a tendency referred to as *growth mania*. The dark green brand of environmentalism is associated with ideas of , [deep ecology](../Page/深層生態學.md "wikilink"), , [anti-consumerism](../Page/反消費主義.md "wikilink"), [post-materialism](../Page/後物質主義.md "wikilink"), [holism](../Page/整全觀.md "wikilink"), the [Gaia hypothesis](../Page/蓋亞假說.md "wikilink") of [James Lovelock](../Page/詹姆斯·洛夫洛克.md "wikilink"), as well as support for a [reduction in human numbers](../Page/人口控制.md "wikilink") and/or a [relinquishment of technology](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/無政府原始主義 "wikilink") to reduce humanity's effect on the [biosphere](../Page/生物圈.md "wikilink").

More recently, *bright greens* emerged as a group of environmentalists who believe that radical changes are needed in the economic and political operation of society in order to make it sustainable, but that better designs, new technologies and more widely distributed social innovations are the means to make those changes—and that society can neither stop nor protest its way to [sustainability](../Page/可持續性.md "wikilink").\[12\] As Ross Robertson writes,

## International perspective

While bright green environmentalism is an intellectual current among North American environmentalists (with a number of businesses, [blogs](../Page/網誌.md "wikilink"), [NGOs](../Page/非政府组织.md "wikilink") and even governments now explicitly calling themselves *bright green*—for instance, the City of Vancouver's strategic planning document is called "Vancouver 2020: A Bright Green Future"\[13\]), it is in Northern Europe, especially Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, that the idea of bright green environmentalism has become most widespread and most widely discussed. For instance, the official technology showcase and business expo for the [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change](../Page/联合国气候变化框架公约.md "wikilink") in [Copenhagen](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/哥本哈根 "wikilink") is called *Bright Green* in reference to this idea,\[14\] while the Danish youth  movement is called *Bright Green Youth*.

***生於紅燈區(Born into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids)***是2004年印度裔美國人的紀錄片，講述著[加爾各答紅燈區的索納加奇妓女的故事](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/加爾各答 "wikilink")。由Zana Briski和Ross Kauffman所執導的一部廣受好評的電影，贏得許多讚譽，也包括了2005年[奧斯卡最佳紀錄片獎](../Page/奥斯卡最佳纪录片奖.md "wikilink")。

## 情節

紀錄片攝影師布里斯基（Briski）去加爾各答拍攝當地妓女。在那時，她結識了他們的孩子，並主動提出要教孩子們攝影，以換取被允許為其母親照相的機會。The children were given cameras so they could learn [photography](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/photography "wikilink") and possibly improve their lives. Their photographs depicted a life in the [red light district](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_light_district "wikilink") through the eyes of children typically overlooked and sworn off to do chores around the house until they were able to contribute more substantially to the family welfare. Much of their work was used in the film, and the filmmakers recorded the classes as well as daily life in the red light district. The children's work was exhibited, and one boy was even sent to a photography conference in Amsterdam. Briski also recorded her efforts to place the children in boarding schools although many of the children did not end up staying very long in the schools they were placed in. Others, such as Avijit and Kochi not only went on to continue their education, but were graded well.

## 後果

There is debate about the extent to which the documentary has improved the lives of the children featured in it.

The filmmakers claim that the lives of children appearing in *Born into Brothels* have been transformed by money earned through the sale of photos and a book on them. Ross Kauffman, co-director of the documentary, says that the amount earned is $100,000 (about [Rs.](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee "wikilink")4.5 million), which will pay for their tuition and for a school in India for children of prostitutes. Briski has started a [non-profit organization](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO "wikilink") to continue this kind of work in other countries, named [Kids with Cameras](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_with_Cameras "wikilink").\[1\] A film is being made on the life story of a high-profile trio of call girl sisters, Shaveta, Khushboo and Himani, born in one of the brothels of Haryana.

In November 2006, [Kids with Cameras](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_with_Cameras "wikilink") provided an update on many of the children's conditions, asserting that they had entered high schools or universities in India and the United States or found employment outside of prostitution. Kids with Cameras continues to work toward improving the lives of children from the Calcutta red light district with the plan to build a Hope House.\[2\] Updates for 2010 and 2009 were also published.\[3\]\[4\]

In 2004, REACT to FILM organized a screening for *Born into Brothels* at the [SoHo House](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soho_House_\(club\) "wikilink") in Manhattan, NY. In 2010, the film's director, [Zana Briski](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zana_Briski "wikilink"), joined the advisory board of REACT to FILM.\[5\]

## Criticisms

The [Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbar_Mahila_Samanwaya_Committee "wikilink"), a prostitutes' organization active in Sonagachi, has criticized the film for presenting the children's parents as abusive and for ignoring the prostitutes' efforts to provide education programs and career building activities for their children.\[6\] In addition, the film has been criticized in India for perceived [racist](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/racist "wikilink") [stereotyping](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/stereotyping "wikilink"), and has also been viewed as exploiting the children for the purposes of [Indophobic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indophobia "wikilink") propaganda in the West.\[7\] A review in [Frontline](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontline_\(magazine\) "wikilink"), India's national magazine, summarized this criticism, remarking:

Some critics joined the Sonagachi prostitute-advocacy groups in condemning the film for exploitation of the plight of the prostitutes for profit.\[8\] Other criticisms were raised about "ethical and stylistic" problems, by Partha Banerjee, interpreter between the filmmakers and the children.\[9\]

## Life

### Early life and education

Savage was born on 21 February 1906 in [Edinburgh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh "wikilink"), [Scotland](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland "wikilink"),\[9\] to [Richard Akinwande Savage](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Akinwande_Savage "wikilink") Sr, a [Nigerian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian "wikilink") [medical doctor](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/medical_doctor "wikilink"), newspaper publisher and a 1900 Edinburgh graduate of [Sierra Leone Creole descent](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone_Creole "wikilink") and Maggie S. Bowie, a [working-class](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/working-class "wikilink") [Scotswoman](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotswoman "wikilink").\[10\] Her brother was [Richard Gabriel Akinwande Savage](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gabriel_Akinwande_Savage "wikilink"), also a doctor who graduated from Edinburgh in 1926.\[11\] Savage passed exams to the [Royal College of Music](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Music "wikilink") in 1919 and was given a scholarship to study at [George Watson’s Ladies College](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Watson's_College "wikilink").\[12\] There, she received an award for General Proficiency in Class Work and passed the Scottish Higher Education Leaving Certificate.\[13\]\[14\]\[15\]

She entered [Edinburgh University](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_University "wikilink") to study medicine, excelled in her studies. In her fourth year of medical school, she obtained first class honours in all subjects, won a prize in *‘Diseases of the Skin’* and a medal in Forensic Medicine - becoming the first woman in the history of Edinburgh to do so.\[16\] She was awarded the Dorothy Gilfillan Memorial Prize as the best woman graduate in 1929.\[17\]

### Medical career and legacy

Savage faced gender and racial institutional barriers in her career.\[18\] After graduation, she joined the colonial service in the [Gold Coast](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_\(British_colony\) "wikilink") (present-day Ghana) as a Junior Medical Officer. Though better qualified than most of her male counterparts, she received fewer benefits.\[19\]\[20\]

In 1931, she was recruited by the headmaster of [Achimota College](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achimota_College "wikilink"). At the urging of the headmaster, [Alec Garden Fraser](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Garden_Fraser "wikilink"), the colonial government gave her a better contract. She was with [Achimota](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achimota_School "wikilink") for four years as a [medical officer](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/medical_officer "wikilink") and a teacher.\[21\] While at Achimota, she came into contact with [Susan de Graft-Johnson](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Ofori-Atta "wikilink") when the latter was the Girls' School Prefect. Johnson regularly worked with Savage at the sick bay\[22\] and later went on to also study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, becoming Ghana's first female medical doctor.\[23\] Another West African woman medical pioneer who studied at both Achimota and [Edinburgh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh_Medical_School "wikilink") was [Matilda J. Clerk](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_J._Clerk "wikilink"), who became the first Ghanaian woman to win a university merit scholarship, the second female doctor in Ghana and the fourth West African woman to train as a [physician](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/physician "wikilink").\[24\]\[25\]

After Achimota, Savage went back to the colonial medical service and was given a better concession, she was in charge of the infant welfare clinics, associated with [Korle Bu Hospital](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korle-Bu_Teaching_Hospital "wikilink") in Accra. Concurrently, she was appointed the assistant medical officer to the maternity department of the hospital and warden of the nurses’ hostel. At Korle-Bu, she supervised the establishment of a training school for nurses, [Korle-Bu Nurses Training College](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korle-Bu_Nurses_Training_College "wikilink"), where a ward was named in her honour.\[26\]\[27\]

## Death

Savage retired relatively early due to "physical and psychological exhaustion" in 1947 and spent the remainder of her life in Scotland raising her niece and nephew. She died of a [stroke](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/stroke "wikilink") in 1964.

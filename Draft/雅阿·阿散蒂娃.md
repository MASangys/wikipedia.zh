**雅阿·阿散蒂娃**（**Yaa Asantewaa，** 12月17, 1840 – October 17, 1921） 在阿散蒂帝國的Ejisu的王后母親 - 現在是現代加納的一部分, 由她的兄弟Nana Akwasi Afrane Opese任命, the Edwesuhene, 或統治者,

Edwesu。 1900年，她領導了Ashanti戰爭，稱為金戰爭之戰,也被稱為Yaa Asantewaa戰爭，反對英國殖民主義.\[1\]

## Early years

Born in  1840 in , in southern Ghana, Yaa Asantewaa was the older of two children. Her brother, Afrane Panin, became the chief of Edweso, a nearby community. After a childhood without incident, she cultivated crops on the land around . She entered a [polygamous marriage](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/多配偶制 "wikilink") with a man from Kumasi, with whom she had a daughter.\[2\]

## Prelude to rebellion

在她的兄弟統治期間，Yaa Asantewaa看到Ashanti聯邦經歷了一系列威脅其未來的事件, 包括1883年至1888年的內戰. 當她的哥哥於1894年去世, Yaa Asantewaa利用她作為王太后的權利提名她自己的孫子作為Ejisuhene. 當英國人於1896年將他驅逐到塞舌爾時, 與Asante Prempeh I國王和Asante政府的其他成員一起, Yaa Asantewaa成為Ejisu-Juaben區的攝政王.在PrempehI被驅逐出境後, 英國黃金海岸總督弗雷德里克霍奇森,要求金凳子, the symbol of the Asante nation.\[3\] This request led to a secret meeting of the remaining members of the Asante government at [Kumasi](../Page/库马西.md "wikilink"), to discuss how to secure the return of their king. There was a disagreement among those present on how to go about this. Yaa Asantewaa, who was present at this meeting, stood and addressed the members of the council with these now-famous words:\[4\]

Yaa Asantewaa was chosen by a number of regional Asante kings to be the war-leader of the Asante fighting force. This is the first and only example for a woman to be given that role in Asante history.\[5\] The Ashanti-British "War of the Golden Stool" was led by Queen Mother Nana Yaa Asantewaa with an army of 5,000. \[6\]

## The rebellion and its aftermath

[Yaa_Asantewaa's_Cell.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yaa_Asantewaa's_Cell.jpg "fig:Yaa_Asantewaa's_Cell.jpg") Beginning in March 1900, the rebellion laid siege to the fort at Kumasi where the British had sought refuge. The fort still stands today as the Kumasi Fort and Military Museum. After several months, the Gold Coast governor eventually sent a force of 1,400 to quell the rebellion. During the fighting, Queen Yaa Asantewaa and fifteen of her closest advisers were captured, and they, too, were sent into exile to the Seychelles.\[7\] The rebellion represented the final war in the [Anglo-Asante](../Page/英国-阿散蒂战争.md "wikilink") series of wars that lasted throughout the 19thcentury. On January 1, 1902 the British fully seized the land that the Asante army had been defending from them for almost a century, and the Asante empire was made a [protectorate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/保护国 "wikilink") of the British crown.\[8\]

Yaa Asantewaa died in exile in the Seychelles on October 17, 1921. Three years after her death, on December 27, 1924, PrempehI and the other remaining members of the exiled Asante court were allowed to return to Asante. PrempehI made sure that the remains of Yaa Asantewaa and the other exiled Asantes were returned for a proper royal burial.\[9\] Yaa Asantewaa's dream for an Asante free of British rule was realized on March 6, 1957, when the Asante protectorate gained independence as part of Ghana. Ghana was the first African nation in [Sub-Saharan Africa](../Page/撒哈拉以南非洲.md "wikilink") to achieve this feat.\[10\]

## Social roles of Asante women

Asantewaa understood the ramifications of British occupation. She is seen by Ghanaians today as a queen mother who exercised her political and social clout to help defend her kingdom. The role she played in influencing the Ashanti men to battle the British appears to be a function of her [matriarchal](../Page/母權.md "wikilink") status. \[11\]The experience of seeing a woman serving as political and military head of an empire was foreign to British colonial troops in 19th-century Africa. Yaa Asantewaa's call upon the women of the Asante Empire is based on the political obligations of Akan women and their respective roles in legislative and judicial processes. The hierarchy of male stools among the Akan people was complemented by female counterparts. Within the village, elders who were heads of the matrilineages (*mpanyimfo*), constituted the village council known as the *ôdekuro*. The women, known as the *mpanyinfo*, and referred to as *aberewa* or *ôbaa panyin*, were responsible for looking after women's affairs. For every *ôdekuro*, an *ôbaa panyin* acted as the responsible party for the affairs of the women of the village and served as a member of the village council.\[12\]

The head of a division, the *ôhene*, and the head of the autonomous political community, the *ômanhene*, had their female counterparts known as the *ôhemaa*: a female ruler who sat on their councils. The *ôhemaa* and *ôhene* were all of the same *mogya*, blood or localized matrilineage. The occupant of the female stool in Kumasi state, the *Asantehemaa*, the united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex-officio of the Asanthene, was a member of the Kôtôkô Council, the Executive Committee or Cabinet of the Asanteman *Nhyiamu*, General Assembly of Asante rulers. Female stool occupants participated not only in the judicial and legislative processes, but also in the making and unmaking of war, and the distribution of land.\[13\]

## Place in history and cultural legacy

Yaa Asantewaa remains a much-loved figure in Asante history and the history of Ghana as a whole for her role in confronting the colonialism of the British. She is immortalized in song as follows:

To highlight the importance of encouraging more female leaders in Ghanaian society, the  was established at Kumasi in 1960 with funds from the [Ghana Education Trust](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_Education_Trust "wikilink").\[14\]

In the year 2000, a week-long centenary celebration was held in Ghana to acknowledge Yaa Asantewaa's accomplishments. As part of these celebrations, a  was dedicated to her at  in the Ejisu–Juaben District on 3August 2000. Unfortunately, a fire on 23July 2004 destroyed several historical items, including her sandals and battle dress (*batakarikese*) seen in the photograph above.\[15\] The current Queen-mother of Ejisu is Yaa AsantewaaII. A second Yaa Asantewaa festival was held 1–5August 2006 in Ejisu.\[16\]

A television documentary by Ivor Agyeman–Duah, entitled *Yaa AsantewaaThe Exile of King Prempeh and the Heroism of An African Queen*, premiered in Ghana in 2001.\[19\]

A stage show written by , *Yaa Asantewaa: Warrior Queen*, directed by  and featuring master drummer ,\[20\]\[21\] with a pan-African cast, toured the UK and Ghana in 2001–02.\[22\]\[23\] A radio drama by the same author was also serialized October 13-17, 2003.\[24\] on [BBC Radio Four](../Page/BBC廣播四台.md "wikilink")'s **.\[25\]\[26\]

The “**A Candy Rain**” campaign originated from the original book by Mr. Zhang Hejun, the Ukrainian illustrator Nikola Lomakin and the color expert Lyudmila Osipova. A classic fragment of a candy rain. In order to let more children eat candy, Emily, the little girl in the book, is willing to be misunderstood by her parents and secretly accumulate candy. In order to realize Emily's dream, the residents of the town of Nutren, with the help of the magma barber, gave the children a real candy rain through the volcano. On June 1, 2019, the first candy rain event was held at the Beijing Jintai Art Museum, hosted by the China Children's Charity Foundation, the Kyushu Cultural Communication Center and the Jintai Art Museum. The first United Nations environmental art master Yuan Xikun and the famous actor Zhang Xiaolong were hired as the first "Mr. Candy". On July 10, 2019, Yuan Xikun fulfilled the promise made during the Children's Day on June 1 in the "Water Cube" (National Swimming Center). Together with the coach of the swimming pool club, he helped Taiwanese friend Li Tingjun realize his dream of learning to swim. The Water Cube officially became a dream workshop for “a candy rain” event. \[1\] "A candy rain" helps children to dream together

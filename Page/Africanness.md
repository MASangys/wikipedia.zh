Africanness, as composed by “African” plus the suffix “-ness”, indicates
African-related qualities, characters, measures, states of being.

Africanness can be construed based on ethnicity and a shared ancestry of
black. The diasporic black people would thus claim an important share in
accounting for Africanness, considering the effects accumulated in
colonialism, slavery, and massive migration. For instance, there were
approximately 5 million slaves transported to Bahia in South America,
which has credited Bahia as “the most African part of Brazil.” As the
voyager Avé Lallement put it, dating back in 1859, “If one did not know
that Bahia was located in Brazil, it could easily be mistaken for an
African capital, the residence of a powerful black prince... Everything
looks black: one sees blacks on the beach, blacks in the city, blacks in
the lower town, blacks in the higher neighborhoods. Everything that
runs, shouts, works, everything that transports and carries is
black.”\[1\] Therefore, the map of Africanness entails a much broader
drawing of the African continent.

The elements of Africanness are particularly archived and appreciated in
such areas as music, religion, decorative artwork. Signatory musical
traits of Africanness include call and response, relative pitch,
drumming, and sacred dance.\[2\] Some representative customs of
Africanness include the elaborate West African dresses, as well as the
nyama choma (roasted meat) and Tusker (a local beer brand) treat before
a going-out.\[3\]

Meanwhile, a strong consensus of Africanness and blackness has not yet
been reached by all the black people across the world. For instance, the
black people in Brazil have adapted the black Sisterhood of the Good
Death to its localized version, where a white saint image is worshiped
and an affiliation with Catholicism and Candomblé is constructed.\[4\]
Such modified Africanness might be contested as lacking in purity,
deficient as heretical, be compromising its Africanness at all.

The metric of blackness in association with Africanness being
identified, it is noted that Africanness might be solicited from various
perspectives. For instance, Tatamkhulu Afrika, an activist and writer,
who was born to a Turkish father and Egyptian mother, has poignantly
oriented and expressed his self-hood and self-identity as being an
African.\[5\] Put in more literary and artistic terms, some would
critique that “blackness \[is\] a condition of the soul.”\[6\] Resorting
to an essentialist point of view, Africanness is not restrained
geo-politically or in ethnic terms, but expansively cultivated by those
shared histories, cultures, and characters concerning Africa.

Besides, within the world of black people, the widely arisen motifs of
inequality, hierarchies, power disparity, consonance and dissonance also
exist. For instance, the global North black and the global South black
might have different understandings and manifestations of Africanness.
When such differences are exposed (in such occasions as global tourism),
the difficulties in sorting out Africanness and blackness might be
substantiated.\[7\] In this regard, it is ambiguous whether and to what
extent can the ties established upon race and ethnicity transcend the
divergence rendered by class and other socioeconomic factors.

Africanness can suggest negativeness. The episodes of colonialism,
imperialism and slavery had witnessed several systemic anti-black
racism. It is observed that, upon apartheid, racial terms had encroached
many aspects of African lives. For instance, racial division was
expressed in food distribution regime in jail, as “pork for blacks,
mutton and beef for the other races.”\[8\] Similar racial hostilities
were shown by some American racists’ slogans, such as “Leave your
Africanness outside the door.”\[9\] Also, the African ways of worshiping
are at times criticized as resorting to superstition and primitivism.
The centuries-long colonial rule is perceived and prosecuted by some
researchers as having committed gross and blatant mis-recognition of
African spirituality - by way of perceiving and prosecuting African
worship as evil, satanic, and condemnable.\[10\] During those decades
and perhaps centuries, Africanness was allegedly “feminized,” - rendered
peripheral and inferior by the Westerners and the industrialization
process.\[11\]

Partly as a response, Africans have been saving the grace of
Africanness. In the New World, African-Americans have expressed and
endorsed their Africanness via such events as Marcus Garvey’s “back to
Africa” movement and the Pan-African congresses which note on the
commonality of the black people.\[12\] Some drama artists advocate for
Africanness and the authentic black cultures, with a black sensibility
and a notion of “Claim what is yours.”\[13\] Also, African-concerned
religions have been positively interacting and cross-impacting with
spirituality around the world. The Puerto Rican brujeria is an instance
of Africanization due to the African diaspora.\[14\]

Beyond that, African heritage and black peculiarity are at occasions
highlighted with added activism. For instance, there are African voices
that rebut the Westerners’ accounts of female circumcision in Africa -
asserting that, female circumcision is more of a cultural and voluntary
choice within certain African ethnic groups, rather than some forced or
coerced savagery dehumanizing projects against women.\[15\] Such
activism should be considered with its defensive and corrective
missions, within the context where Westernization and modernity have
been dominating and overwhelming all over the place, and wherein arises
a legitimate concern of Africanness becoming un-African.

Similar as in an archival work, the conception and representation of
Africanness would be greatly contingent on its collector, composer, and
curator.\[16\] While some would keynote on the orthodox, the traditions,
the heritages of Africa, a revival and an “African renaissance”; some
would explore the alternatives of contemporary African development, the
African avant-garde, and “being modern the African way” \[17\] While
some would consider the coining of Africanness - similar with
Europeanness and Asianness, is playing on racial labels, entailed by the
raised awareness of being qualitatively different and separated, and
further, by the dichotomies of the one and the other, inclusion versus
exclusion; some would deem Africanness as a branch of sub-cultures,
within the globalization framework.

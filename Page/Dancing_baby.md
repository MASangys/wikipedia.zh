Plot

The Dance Gang Race completely destroyed the world of dance. After the
sacred family was joined by the celestial family, the saints also sealed
the seal on the ground, and the saints retreated to the holy cloud
country to recuperate. The Dance Item "Dowa La" that caused the troubled
world was handed over by the Tianzu to be hidden among the human race...

In the past 6000 years, it was again in the holy mixed-wave field, and
the king was determined to turn around and turn around. The Dance Gang
went to Dongyin Elementary School to know the whereabouts of the Dance
Item.

The Queen appointed the three guardians to go to the vicinity of Dongyin
Elementary School to train three ordinary girls to become Dancing
Babies, in order to protect the two worlds.

Unexpectedly, the Dance Gang were prepared to use the abandoned puppets
to create a wave of chaos, and the innocence of the Dancing Babies
caused serious problems.

With so many difficulties, can "Dofala" really return to the holy cloud
country intact?

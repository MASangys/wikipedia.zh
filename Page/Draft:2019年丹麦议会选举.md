**General elections** were held in
[Denmark](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/丹麦 "wikilink") on 5 June 2019 to
elect all 179 members of the
[Folketing](../Page/丹麥議會.md "wikilink");\[1\] 175 in
[Denmark](../Page/丹麥地理.md "wikilink") proper, two in the [Faroe
Islands](../Page/法罗群岛.md "wikilink") and two in
[Greenland](../Page/格陵兰.md "wikilink"). The elections took place
ten days after the .\[2\]

The elections resulted in a victory for the "red bloc", comprising
parties that supported the [Social
Democrats](../Page/社会民主党_\(丹麦\).md "wikilink")' leader
[Mette Frederiksen](../Page/梅特·弗雷德里克森.md "wikilink") as candidate for
Prime Minister. The "red bloc" -- consisting of the Social Democrats,
the [Social Liberals](../Page/丹麥社會自由黨.md "wikilink"), [Socialist
People's Party](../Page/社會主義人民黨.md "wikilink"), the [Red–Green
Alliance](../Page/团结名单－红绿联盟.md "wikilink"), the
[Faroese](../Page/法罗群岛.md "wikilink") [Social Democratic
Party](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/社会民主党_\(法罗群岛\) "wikilink"), and the
Greenlandic [Siumut](../Page/前进_\(政党\).md "wikilink")\[3\] -- won 93 of
the 179 seats, securing a parliamentary majority. Meanwhile, the
incumbent governing coalition, consisting of
[Venstre](../Page/左翼，丹麦自由党.md "wikilink"), the [Liberal
Alliance](../Page/自由聯盟_\(丹麥\).md "wikilink") and the [Conservative
People's Party](../Page/保守人民党_\(丹麦\).md "wikilink"), and receiving
outside parliamentary support from the [Danish People's
Party](../Page/丹麥人民黨.md "wikilink") and , was reduced to 76 seats
(including the [Venstre](../Page/左翼，丹麦自由党.md "wikilink")-affiliated
[Union Party](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/联盟党_\(法罗群岛\) "wikilink") in
the [Faroe Islands](../Page/法罗群岛.md "wikilink")).

On 6 June 2019, incumbent Prime Minister [Lars Løkke
Rasmussen](../Page/拉爾斯·勒克·拉斯穆森.md "wikilink") of the
[centre-right](../Page/中間偏右.md "wikilink")
[liberal](../Page/自由主义.md "wikilink")
[Venstre](../Page/左翼，丹麦自由党.md "wikilink") party tendered
his government's resignation to Queen [Margrethe
II](../Page/瑪格麗特二世_\(丹麥\).md "wikilink"), allowing her
to appoint Frederiksen to form a new government.\[4\]

## Background

At the [2015 general election](../Page/2015年丹麥大選.md "wikilink"), a
narrow majority was won by the [Danish People's
Party](../Page/丹麥人民黨.md "wikilink"),
[Venstre](../Page/左翼，丹麦自由党.md "wikilink"), [Liberal
Alliance](../Page/自由聯盟_\(丹麥\).md "wikilink") and the [Conservative
People's Party](../Page/保守人民党_\(丹麦\).md "wikilink"), colloquially known
as the "blue bloc". They won 90 seats in the Folketing versus 89 seats
for the remaining parties, all belonging to the "red bloc". Ten days
later, [Lars Løkke Rasmussen](../Page/拉爾斯·勒克·拉斯穆森.md "wikilink"), the
leader of Venstre, became [Prime
Minister](../Page/丹麦首相列表.md "wikilink"), when Venstre formed
a  supported by the remaining parties in the "blue bloc".\[5\] In
November 2016, Rasmussen formed a , now a coalition with Liberal
Alliance, and the Conservative People's Party.\[6\]

## Electoral system

Of the 179 members of the Folketing, 175 are elected in Denmark proper,
two in [Faroe Islands](../Page/法罗群岛.md "wikilink") and two in
[Greenland](../Page/格陵兰.md "wikilink"). In Denmark there are ten
multi-member constituencies containing a total of 135 seats directly
elected by [proportional representation](../Page/比例代表制.md "wikilink"),
with seats allocated using a modified version of the [Sainte-Laguë
method](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/聖拉古法 "wikilink") and [Hare
quota](../Page/黑爾數額.md "wikilink"). An additional 40 seats are used to
address any imbalance in the distribution of the constituency seats, and
are distributed among all parties that cross the 2% [election
threshold](../Page/選舉門檻.md "wikilink"), according to their national vote
share.\[7\]\[8\]

Voters could choose between casting a personal vote for a candidate, or
voting for a political party. The votes given to political parties are
distributed among the candidates for that party. This can either be done
in proportion to their personal votes, or by giving them to candidates
in a predetermined order. All parties except the [Red-Green
Alliance](../Page/团结名单－红绿联盟.md "wikilink") make use of the first
option.\[9\]

According to the , the 2019 election was required to be held no later
than 17 June 2019, as the [previous
elections](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Danish_general_election "wikilink")
were held on 18 June 2015.\[10\]\[11\] The Prime Minister is able to
call the election at any date,\[12\] provided that date is no later than
four years from the previous election,\[13\] and this is cited as a
tactical advantage for the sitting government.\[14\]

For a new party to become eligible to participate in the election, they
must be supported by a number of voters corresponding to 1/175 of all
valid votes cast in the previous election. A new party registering to
contest the 2019 elections required 20,109 voter declarations to
participate.\[15\]

## Participating parties

### Denmark

All nine parties that held seats in the Folketing contested the
elections.\[16\] Four other parties also gained ballot access: three new
parties on the right and the , who lost representation in the . In
October 2016, , a new right-wing party, became eligible to run in the
election,\[17\] and a year later, in October 2017, the Christian
Democrats did likewise. The latter had participated in every election
from 1971 to 2005.\[18\]

In February 2019, the party , named after [its
founder](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Riskær_Pedersen "wikilink"),
collected the necessary voter declarations and became eligible too,
despite, breaking the rules for collection of declarations. Riskær
Pedersen found a way to circumvent a 7-day "thinking period" between a
voter noting their support for a party and then confirming their
signature in the online collection system.\[19\] Even though the rules
did not allow this, they contained no possibility of sanctions.\[20\]
Following this, all political parties in the Folketing agreed to close
the loophole and build a new portal for declarations, expected to be
available in the end 2020.\[21\]

In April 2019, following unrest at
[Nørrebro](../Page/諾雷布羅.md "wikilink") cause by demonstrations
by  politician , his party  managed to collect the required
signatures.\[22\] Paludan, and his party, has been surrounded with
controversy. With demonstrations containing activities like throwing the
[Quran](../Page/古兰经.md "wikilink") around, burning the Quran and
harassing Muslims. In April 2019, Paludan was sentenced for violating a
paragraph in the  colloquially known as the "racism paragraph".\[23\] He
had also circumvented the "thinking period" in the same manner as Riskær
Pedersen.\[24\]

## Campaign

### Early statements

In October 2017, , a new right-wing political party that became eligible
to run in October 2016,\[37\] listed three demands for a candidate for
Prime Minister to receive their support. All three demands were
tightenings of the immigration policy.\[38\]

On 4 June 2018, the [Social
Democrats](../Page/社会民主党_\(丹麦\).md "wikilink"), the
largest opposition party, stated that if they were to win the election,
they wished to form a single-party government led by their leader [Mette
Frederiksen](../Page/梅特·弗雷德里克森.md "wikilink"), i.e. not as a coalition
government with the [Social Liberal
Party](../Page/丹麥社會自由黨.md "wikilink"). This was done in
order to both pursue traditional centre-left issues, and to have a
strict immigration policy.\[39\] [Morten
Østergaard](../Page/莫滕·奧斯特加德.md "wikilink"), the leader
of the Social Liberal Party, responded by saying that if the Social
Democrats wanted their support, they would also need to give them
concessions.\[40\] The message was welcomed by the anti-immigration
[Danish People's Party](../Page/丹麥人民黨.md "wikilink"), which supported
the centre-right party Venstre in the election. Their leader [Kristian
Thulesen Dahl](../Page/克里斯蒂安·圖勒森·達爾.md "wikilink"), said that this would
ensure that they could get through with their immigration policy, no
matter which party won the election.\[41\]

On 26 June 2018, , which traditionally is regarded as belonging to the
"red bloc", stated that they no longer would support Mette Frederiksen
as candidate to become Prime Minister. Instead, they would support their
own political leader, [Uffe Elbæk](../Page/宇菲·額利貝克.md "wikilink"), as a
way to "pull their seats from the equation" after the election.\[42\]
This was done because they did not regard the other parties' ambitions
concerning [climate change](../Page/氣候變遷.md "wikilink") to be
sufficient.\[43\] The move was met with criticism, as Elbæk's chances
are very slim, and it could risk keeping Lars Løkke Rasmussen as Prime
Minister.\[44\]

### Campaign begins

The election campaign started on 7 May 2019, when [Prime
Minister](../Page/丹麦首相列表.md "wikilink") Lars Løkke Rasmussen announced
that the election would be held on 5 June, which is . At the time of
announcement, [Mette Frederiksen](../Page/梅特·弗雷德里克森.md "wikilink"),
leader of the Social Democrats and contender to the office of Prime
Minister, was sick and unable to participate in the televised debates
between all party leaders held on the same evening. Instead, former
minister  represented the Social Democrats in the debates.\[45\]
Frederiksen started campaigning on 10 May.\[46\]

Shortly before the election was called, [Hard
Line](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Line_\(political_party\) "wikilink"),
a new far-right party which wants to ban
[Islam](../Page/伊斯兰教.md "wikilink"), became eligible to
participate in the election.\[47\] In the beginning of the campaign,
much attention was given to the party, and especially their leader
.\[48\]\[49\] Both Løkke Rasmussen and Frederiksen said that they would
not base a government on their potential seats, and other party leaders
rejected to cooperate with the party, should they gain seats.\[50\]
While [Venstre](../Page/左翼，丹麦自由党.md "wikilink"), [Liberal
Alliance](../Page/自由聯盟_\(丹麥\).md "wikilink") and the
[Conservatives](../Page/保守人民党_\(丹麦\).md "wikilink") said that Hard Line
should not be considered as part of the "blue bloc" when committee seats
are distributed, the Danish People's Party were open to that
possibility.\[51\] On 8 May, when Paludan was guest in a TV-show, he
called , a former politician, a "[Nazi](../Page/纳粹主义.md "wikilink")
pig", shortly after she had said that Paludan's thoughts were "close to
Nazi a mindset". Jakobsen threatened to sue, but ultimately decided not
to.\[52\] On 9 May media revealed that Paludan had been given a  due to
[stalking](../Page/纏擾.md "wikilink"),\[53\] with more details following
a week later. From 2010 to 2013 he had been stalking a 24-year old man
he met while studying [Latin](../Page/拉丁语.md "wikilink"), and in 2015 he
was sentenced a fine for offending a police officer who handled the
case.\[54\]\[55\] Paludan declined to comment, saying it regarded his
private life.\[56\]

On 13 May the  announced that their leader  would take a [leave of
absence](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/休假 "wikilink") due to , and that
deputy chairman  would become acting chairman. On the first evening of
the campaign, Grenov had participated in a televised debate on  and was
supposed to participate in another debate at , but became ill and was
replaced by Arendt. She was hailed by her performance in that debate,
dubbed the "substitute from heaven".\[57\]\[58\] Following the change in
chairman, media speculated if the change was a tactical move, as Arendt
was perceived to have a broader appeal than Grenov, and as a young woman
could improve the party's image,\[59\]\[60\] but both Grenov and Arendt
denied that tactics played a role in the decision.\[61\] On 28 May,
Grenov announced that he would step down as chairman at the party's
October conference, and supported Arendt as new chairman.\[62\]

### Talks about an SV coalition government

On 16 May, Løkke Rasmussen published a book, in which he was open to a
possible coalition government between Venstre and the Social Democrats
(an SV-government). He said that he offered to be the "grown up", as a
[coalition across the political middle](../Page/大聯合政府.md "wikilink")
would be better than a government depending on the outermost political
wings, but stressed that he and Venstre still campaigned for a
centre-right government.\[63\]\[64\] The announcement was remarkable and
regarded as a gamble; Løkke Rasmussen called it a "game changer".\[65\]
Prominent figures in Venstre, among those deputy chairman and Minister
of Finance  and Minister for Immigration , were deeply critical of the
idea,\[66\] while other supported the idea.\[67\] Denmark had an
SV-government between 1978 and 1979. [That
government](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jørgensen_III_Cabinet "wikilink"),
under Prime Minister [Anker
Jørgensen](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/安高·约恩森 "wikilink") of
the Social Democrats, was widely regarded as a fiasco.\[68\]

The idea of an SV-government were immediately rejected by Frederiksen,
who said that the political differences are too big, and reiterated that
the Social Democrats wished to form a single-party government after the
election.\[69\] Among the parties in the sitting government, [Søren Pape
Poulsen](../Page/瑟倫·佩普·波爾森.md "wikilink"), leader of the Conservative,
said that they could not support an SV-government,\[70\] and [Anders
Samuelsen](../Page/安诺斯·萨穆埃尔森.md "wikilink"), leader of the Liberal
Alliance, said that he was worried about the turn that the election
campaign had taken, and offered free membership of Liberal Alliance for
all members of Venstre.\[71\] On the other hand the [Social
Liberals](../Page/丹麥社會自由黨.md "wikilink") and the [Danish People's
Party](../Page/丹麥人民黨.md "wikilink") welcomed the announcement, while the
[Red-Green Alliance](../Page/团结名单－红绿联盟.md "wikilink") refused to support
such a government.\[72\] ,  and former leader of the Danish People's
Party, called for a majority government between Venstre, the Social
Democrats, and the Danish People's Party, as an SV-government would be
unstable and could give the Social Liberals too much influence on the
immigration policy.\[73\]

On 4 June, the day before the election, Løkke Rasmussen gave up on his
plans to form a centre-right government, saying it was no longer
"realistic". He instead made it his first priority to create a
government across the political middle, in order to keep the right- and
left wing away from power. He did not state which parties should be in
such a government.\[74\] The announcement was met with stark opposition
from his coalition partners. Pape Poulsen rejected taking part in such a
government, questioning what the political foundation should be, while
Samuelsen said that Løkke Rasmussen had "let down" the
[civic](../Page/公民民族主義.md "wikilink")-liberal Denmark.\[75\]
[Kristian Thulesen Dahl](../Page/克里斯蒂安·圖勒森·達爾.md "wikilink"), leader of
the Danish People's Party, said that it was paramount to them to take
part in such a cooperation, so the Social Liberals and The Alternative
did not influence it. He demanded that Løkke Rasmussen choose between
the Social Liberals and the Danish People's Party.\[76\] Frederiksen
once again rejected the idea, and said that "voters must be confused",
as Løkke proposed three different governments during the election
campaign.\[77\] [Morten Østergaard](../Page/莫滕·奧斯特加德.md "wikilink"),
leader of the Social Liberals, said that he would be supporting
Frederiksen as Prime Minister, and that he could not support Løkke
Rasmussen. The day prior, the Social Liberals' vice chairman, , had said
that a government with both Venstre, the Social Democrats and the Social
Liberals would be the "dream scenario".\[78\]

## Results

Overall the election was a win for the "red bloc" – parties that
supported Mette Frederiksen, leader of the Social Democrats, as Prime
Minister. In total, the Social Democrats, the Social Liberals, Socialist
People's Party and the Red–Green Alliance won 91 seats, without the
Alternative, which said they belonged to their own green bloc. Before a
government can be formed, however, there needs to be negotiations on the
formation of the government. Difficult negotiations are expected, as
both the Social Liberals and the Socialist People's Party, who both
doubled their seats, have made clear demands.\[79\]

The Social Democrats defended their position as the largest party, and
won an additional seat despite a slightly reduced voter share. They were
closely followed by Venstre, who saw the largest gains in seats, picking
up an extra nine. In the blue bloc, only Venstre and the Conservative
People's Party saw gains, the latter doubling their seats. The Danish
People's Party's vote share was reduced by 12.4 [percentage
points](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/百分點 "wikilink") (pp), well over
half of their support. Their leader [Kristian Thulesen
Dahl](../Page/克里斯蒂安·圖勒森·達爾.md "wikilink") speculated that the
bad result was due to an extraordinary good election in 2015, and that
some voters felt they could "gain \[their\] policy elsewhere".\[80\] The
Liberal Alliance had a disastrous election, seeing their vote share
reduce by over two-thirds and becoming the smallest party in the
Folketing, only 0.3pp above the 2% [election
threshold](../Page/選舉門檻.md "wikilink"). Their leader [Anders
Samuelsen](../Page/安诺斯·萨穆埃尔森.md "wikilink") was not reelected.\[81\] He
subsequently resigned as leader, and was succeeded by .\[82\]

Of the new parties, only the New Right won seats, with Hard Line, the
Christian Democrats and Klaus Riskær Pedersen failing to cross the
national 2% threshold, although the Christian Democrats were within 200
votes of winning a direct seat in the western Jutland constituency,
which would have given them representation as if the threshold were not
there.\[83\] On election night, [Klaus Riskær
Pedersen](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Riskær_Pedersen "wikilink")
announced that he would dissolve his party.\[84\]

In the Faroe Islands, Republic (which had finished first in the 2015
elections)\[85\] dropped to fourth place and lost their seat. The Union
Party replaced them as the first party while the Social Democratic Party
finished in second place again, retaining their seat.\[86\]

In Greenland the result was a repeat of the 2015 elections, with Inuit
Ataqatigiit and Siumut winning the two seats. Siumut regained
parliamentary representation after their previous MP, Aleqa Hammond, was
expelled from the party in 2016.\[87\]\[88\] Hammond later joined
Nunatta Qitornai,\[89\] which finished fourth and failed to win a
seat.\[90\]\[91\]

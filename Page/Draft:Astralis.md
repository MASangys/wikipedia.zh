## 历史

### 2016

#### 一月至五月

Astralis参加的首场赛事为2016年1月举办的DreamHack Leipzig 2016。Astralis在打败丹麦兄弟战队和实力较强的欧洲战队后成功晋级，但在以比分0-2输给后铩羽而归。在接下来的线下赛事Global eSports Cup中，Astralis三局两胜战胜了Method和[G2 Esports](../Page/G2_Esports.md "wikilink")，再次成功晋级。They would go on to lose the semi-final vs their rivals from the previous year,  1-2 and then defeat CLG in the third-place decider, only losing seven rounds over two maps. ESL Expo Barcelona was up next which featured an unusual format where each team had three lives and a map loss would mean a life lost. Astralis won five maps against [G2 Esports](../Page/G2_Esports.md "wikilink"), x6tence,  and . Astralis narrowly lost a life to G2 and played two close games vs [Fnatic](../Page/Fnatic.md "wikilink") in the faux-final as the only two teams left.

IEM Katowice was next and Astralis would once again top their group and go straight to the semi-final with best-of-one wins over , , E-Frag,  and . Astralis were set to play the last match of the day vs [Fnatic](../Page/Fnatic.md "wikilink"), but due to delays, this didn’t start until midnight and finally finished at 3am with Astralis losing 1-2.

Astralis were expected to go far in MLG Columbus, the eighth CS:GO Major following their 2nd place finish to  at Counter Pit League Season 2. The event started well as Astralis beat  and  to top their group but were rewarded by being drawn against [Fnatic](../Page/Fnatic.md "wikilink") in the Quarterfinals, the favourites to win the whole event after winning their previous six events in a row. Things did not go well for the Swedes though, as Astralis won in two maps, 16-10 on Overpass and 16-5 on Fnatic’s map pick, Cache due to a standout performance from Peter “” Rasmussen. Astralis went on to face  in the semi-final where they narrowly lost Inferno 14-16 and were outclassed on Dust II thanks to stellar performances from Ioann “Edward” Sukhariev and Egor “flamie” Vasilyev.

Over the next few events Astralis did not live up to their reputation of cleaning up in groups and advancing comfortably to playoffs. Their first group stage exit in six months occurred at DreamHack Masters Malmö 2016, where they won the opener vs Lounge Gaming but were upset by their Danish counterparts,  9-16 on their home map Overpass. Astralis drew the hometown heroes, [Ninjas in Pyjamas](../Page/睡衣忍者.md "wikilink") in the decider match and lost 1-2 with poor performances from dupreeh and IGL Finn “karrigan Andersen. NiP would go on to win the event in front of a roaring Swedish crowd. A month later, the team attended ESL Pro League S3 Finals in England. This time they lost to the North American mix of  in a best-of-one 7-16 and came up against the Columbus Major champions, Luminosity. They fought a tough best-of-three, winning the first map and narrowly lost the remaining two despite Nicolai “” Reedtz having a K-D of 81-50. Luminosity went on to win this event in a gruelling best-of-five vs G2. Following this defeat Astralis decided to swap René “cajunb” Borg for Dignitas’ Markus “Kjaerbye” Kjaerbye who was headhunted by Astralis’ coach, Danny “zonic” Sørensen whom he knew from his time coaching him during 2015.

#### June – October

With a month of practice Astralis attended DreamHack Summer 2016, and this time things were looking up as they topped their group, comfortably defeating the Finnish ENCE eSports and Danish [SK Gaming](../Page/SK_Gaming.md "wikilink"). An all too familiar story occurred in playoffs where they faced NiP in the semi-finals and once again fought a strong best-of-three but ultimately lost 1-2, nearly winning on Cobblestone, Astralis’ perma-ban map. Astralis played their  Season 1 group in June, topping their group winning 5 out of 6 maps vs NRG, CLG and [SK Gaming](../Page/SK_Gaming.md "wikilink") with the help of zonic standing in for IGL karrigan who arrived late to the event. They then won best-of-threes vs NRG and CLG. At ECS Season 1 Finals Astralis once again uncharacteristically lost to a North American team, this time being [Team SoloMid](../Page/Team_SoloMid.md "wikilink") led by Kory “SEMPHIS” Friesen. They went on to face  in the decider match and were beaten 0-2.

Astralis went into , the second CS:GO Major of the year with a stand-in for Kjaerbye in the form of Lukas “gla1ve” Rossander. This was because Kjaerbye played and won the European Minor with  and [Valve](../Page/閥門.md "wikilink") rules dictated he had to sit the event out. In [Germany](../Page/德国.md "wikilink"), Astralis defeated their Danish rivals  in the event opener but were destroyed by the CIS  team in the winner’s best-of-one 6-16. Tragedy struck after this loss with Peter "" Rasmussen getting appendicitis and resulted in him watching the remainder of the event from hospital. Coach  rose to the challenge having not played the game since  a month prior and Astralis scraped through to the playoffs besting  2-1. Astralis were drawn vs the Polish legends [Virtus.pro](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtus.pro "wikilink") in the quarterfinals, however they were unable to best them despite a strong performance from device going 68-43 in K-D and taking the Poles to overtime on both maps.

After the Major Astralis returned to Atlanta to attend the  but lost to  0-2 in the quarterfinals. Shortly after they attended Power-LAN, a small Danish event. They advanced to the semi-finals as expected but lost to [Heroic](../Page/英雄.md "wikilink") 1-2, led by their Major stand-in gla1ve. Less than two weeks later Heroic bested Astralis again, this time in the opener at StarLadder StarSeries Season 2 16-13 on Train. Astralis were pitted vs Oleksandr "s1mple" Kostyliev’s Navi in the elimination match and won in overtime 19-17. Astralis won vs the Chinese TyLoo 2-1 to advance to the quarterfinals but once again lost to NiP 1-2.

In October Astralis attended [ESL](../Page/以英語為第二語言或外語.md "wikilink") New York 2016 featuring an 8 team Swiss format in which they grinded past [G2 Esports](../Page/G2_Esports.md "wikilink") 16-13 but didn’t win another map against opponents [SK Gaming](../Page/SK_Gaming.md "wikilink") (former Luminosity), [Fnatic](../Page/Fnatic.md "wikilink") and . A week later they bombed out in the round of 12 at WESG 2016 European Finals losing 1-2 to  with the two maps they lost being 14-16. A breakdown in the team occurred and Astralis decided it was time for karrigan to go, opting for gla1ve instead. karrigan had led the core players since December 2014 to five tournament wins in 2015 but none since forming Astralis.

#### November – December

Astralis returned to what was expected from them after poor placings throughout the majority of 2016 by topping their group at  Season 2 with best-of-one victories against ALTERNATE aTTaX and [SK Gaming](../Page/SK_Gaming.md "wikilink"). A week later they topped their six-team group at IEM Oakland 2016 with wins vs , ,  and TyLoo with the only loss vs [G2 Esports](../Page/G2_Esports.md "wikilink"). This netted them a semi-final spot and they lost 0-2 to [SK Gaming](../Page/SK_Gaming.md "wikilink") 14-16 and 12-16 where Nicolai “device” Reedtz had an uncharacteristically poor showing. The team returned to Atlanta for the  playoffs and reached the final, triumphing over [Ninjas in Pyjamas](../Page/睡衣忍者.md "wikilink") 2-1 with Markus “Kjaerbye” Kjaerbye posting a 1.56 HLTV rating, beating SK 2-0 with a stellar performance by Andreas “[Xyp9x](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astralis "wikilink")” Højsleth. Astralis were expected to win the final vs  after defeating the Brazilian favourites in the semi-final and OpTic causing upsets on the other side of the bracket. The Danes looked like they were on their way to do this with a 16-9 win on Train but lost the next two maps 6-16 and 11-16 with Keith “NAF” Markovic putting up an incredible 78-45 K-D.

Astralis would get revenge against the North American side a week later at ECS Season 2 Finals in Anaheim winning their first match of the group 16-7, followed by a 16-3 trouncing over  with Xyp9x going 25-5 against the European team. In the semi-final Astralis bested [SK Gaming](../Page/SK_Gaming.md "wikilink") 2-0 with device achieving a 46-19 K-D over 45 rounds. OpTic met them in the final but this time the Danish side were too hot for them to handle and Astralis obtained their first trophy since they formed twelve months prior.

### 2018

#### February – December

In February, Kjaerbye unexpectedly left Astralis to join [North](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/北 "wikilink"). Astralis were left scrambling for a fifth player but fortunately, they were able to sign Emil "Magisk" Reif a few days later. This would mark the beginning of an astronomical rise to the top and domination over the Counter-Strike scene. After a quarter-final finish at StarSeries S4 and a semi-final loss at IEM Katowice 2018, they reached the summit after a spectacular performance at DreamHack Marseille 2018, convincingly beating , [Fnatic](../Page/Fnatic.md "wikilink"), and  on their way to the title. Although they lost to  in the grand final after a narrow 3-0 best of five series at IEM Sydney 2018, they bounced back at  Season 7 Finals, swiftly defeating  and beating  3-1 to grab the trophy. They continued their dominance with trophies at ECS Season 5 Finals and , with a semi-final loss to  at  in between.

Astralis then crowned their era with their second Major title at , quickly beating , , and  without dropping a single map in the playoffs. A mere 6 days later, they defeated  2-1 in the grand-final at BLAST Pro Series Istanbul 2018 - after having an undefeated 5-0 group stage - to continue their dominance over the scene.

### 2019

At the IEM Katowice Major 2019, they picked up their third Major title, becoming the second team in CS:GO history (after [Fnatic](../Page/Fnatic.md "wikilink")) to take home three Major titles, and the third to win two majors back-to-back. They made it into the New Champions stage after a convincing 3-0 score in the New Legends stage, beating [Complexity Gaming](../Page/Complexity.md "wikilink"),  and . They then went through the New Champions stage without dropping a single map, beating [Ninjas in Pyjamas](../Page/睡衣忍者.md "wikilink"), , and finally [ENCE](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCE "wikilink") to secure the Major win.

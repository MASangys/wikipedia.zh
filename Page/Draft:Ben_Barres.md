本·巴雷斯 （Ben A. Barres，1954年9月13日– 2017年12月27日）\[1\] 是美國[史丹佛大學](../Page/史丹佛大學.md "wikilink")的[神經生物學家](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscientist "wikilink")\[2\] 。他的研究集中於 [神經系統中](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/nervous_system "wikilink")[神經元與](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/neuron "wikilink")[神經膠質細胞間的交互作用](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroglia "wikilink")。 Beginning in 2008, he was Chair of the Neurobiology Department at [Stanford University School of Medicine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University_School_of_Medicine "wikilink"). He [transitioned to male](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_man "wikilink") in 1997, and became the first openly transgender scientist in the [National Academy of Sciences](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences "wikilink") in 2013.\[3\]

## Early life and education

Barres was born on September 13, 1954, in [West Orange, New Jersey](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Orange,_New_Jersey "wikilink"), [assigned female](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex_assignment "wikilink") and named Barbara. As a child, his salesman father and homemaker mother saw him as a [tomboy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomboy "wikilink").\[4\] Attending a West Orange school, Barres excelled in mathematics and science and was impressed by his eighth-grade teacher, Jeffrey Davis.\[5\]\[6\] He obtained a [Bachelor of Science](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science "wikilink") in Biology from [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "wikilink") (1976), a medical degree (MD) from [Dartmouth Medical School](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisel_School_of_Medicine "wikilink") (1979), and a residency in neurology at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weill_Cornell_Medicine "wikilink").\[7\] During his residency, Barres noted the lack of knowledge about the causes or cures of [neurodegeneration](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/neurodegeneration "wikilink"). In studying pathology reports, he noticed a correlation between neural degeneration and irregular patterns of [glial](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/glia "wikilink") cells in the brain and, intrigued, resigned his residency to pursue research in neuroscience at [Harvard](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "wikilink").\[8\] He completed a [PhD](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy "wikilink") in Neurobiology there in 1990, then did [postdoctoral](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/postdoctoral_researcher "wikilink") training at [University College London](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London "wikilink") under [Martin Raff](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Raff "wikilink").\[9\] In 1993, Barres joined the faculty of Neurobiology at the Stanford School of Medicine. After transitioning to male in 1997, Barres published on sexism in the sciences and, in 2008, was appointed to the Chair of Neurobiology at Stanford.\[10\]\[11\]

## Research

Barres authored or co-authored papers in journals such as [*Nature* *Neuroscience*](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Neuroscience "wikilink"), [Neuron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron_\(journal\) "wikilink"), [Science](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_\(journal\) "wikilink"), and *[Cell](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_\(journal\) "wikilink")*.\[12\] His research involved study of mammalian glial cells of the [central nervous system (CNS)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system "wikilink"), including the exploration of their function and development.

Some of his earliest work studied vertebrate nervous system development, including how and why many neurons fail to survive shortly after forming connections with their targets. These studies investigated how this programmed cell death, [apoptosis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/apoptosis "wikilink"), occurred in such a tremendous scale.\[13\] Additionally, he studied processes such as the prerequisites for and consequences of axon [myelination](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/myelin "wikilink"), and the interactions of various signaling molecules such as [thyroid-hormone](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormones "wikilink") and [retinoic acid](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/retinoic_acid "wikilink") within the formation of glial cells including [oligodendrocytes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/oligodendrocyte "wikilink").\[14\]\[15\]

Early in his time at Stanford, Barres discovered the importance of glial cells in the formation, development, maturation, and regeneration of neurons. His lab also discovered and developed methods for the purification and culturing of retinal ganglion cells and the glial cells with which they interact, including the oligodendrocytes and astrocytes of the optic nerve.

Near the turn of the 21st century he continued his study of glial cells and the mechanisms behind their ability to generate new neurons. He studied control of synapses by glia, and the differentiation of [astrocytes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/astrocyte "wikilink") by [endothelial cells](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium "wikilink"). He investigated the role of the protein [Id2](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID2 "wikilink") in the control of oligodendrocyte development and established that removing this protein led to premature oligodendrocyte maturation.\[16\]

在2010年代，Barres的研究重點是使用免疫淘選（immunopanning），[免疫組織化學染色法](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/免疫組織化學染色法 "wikilink")（immunohistochemistry）, 組織培養（tissue culturing）, 和膜片鉗（patch clamping）等技術以了解Ranvier和髓鞘鞘結（myelin sheaths）的發育調控中細胞間的相互作用；2）確定神經膠質細胞在突觸形成和突觸功能中發揮何種作用 determine to what extent glial cells play a role in synapse formation and function of synapses; 3) identify the signals that promote retinal ganglia growth and survival, and how such knowledge of these signals could be regenerated post-trauma; 4) identify the functions and developmental mechanisms of gray matter astrocytes. In these objectives, his lab discovered a number of novel glial signals for the induction of myelination, axonal sodium channel clustering, and synapse formation processes. Additionally, his lab characterized these processes and the exact identity of these novel signals.\[17\]

## Experience of sexism

Barres described experiences of [gender discrimination](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/gender_discrimination "wikilink") in MIT. After solving a difficult math problem that stumped many male students, his professor charged that it was solved for him by a boyfriend.\[18\] He was the top student in the class, but found it hard to get a willing supervisor for research. He lost a scholarship to a man who had only one publication, while he already had six.\[19\] While earning a PhD at Harvard, he was told that he was to win a scientific competition, which was evidently between him and one man; the Dean confided to him, “I have read both applications, and it’s going to be you; your application is so much better.” But the award was given to the man, who dropped out of science a year later.\[20\]

After [transitioning](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitioning_\(transgender\) "wikilink"), he noticed that people who were not aware of his transgender status treated him with respect much more than when he presented as a woman.\[21\] After delivering his first seminar as a man, one scientist was overheard to comment, “Ben Barres gave a great seminar today, but his work is much better than his sister’s \[believing Barbara to be his sister\] work.”\[22\] In 2012, he recollected the events of his sex change as:\[23\]  Barres was critical of economist [Lawrence Summers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers "wikilink") and others who have claimed that one reason there are fewer women than men in science and engineering professorships might be that fewer women than men had the very high levels of "intrinsic aptitude" that such jobs required.\[24\] He spoke and wrote openly about being a [trans man](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/trans_man "wikilink") and his experiences transitioning [gender identity](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/gender_identity "wikilink") in 1997,\[25\] and his experiences of being treated differently as a female scientist versus a male scientist.\[26\]

## Death

Barres died on 27 December 2017, some 20 months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer,\[27\] at his home in Palo Alto, California. He was survived by his sisters Jeanne and Peggy, and his brother Donald.\[28\]\[29\]

## Awards and honors

Barres's research awards include a Life Sciences Research Fellowship, the Klingenstein Fellowship Award, a McKnight Investigator Award,\[30\] and a Searle Scholar Award. He has also won teaching awards: the Kaiser Award for Excellence in Teaching, and the Kaiser Award for Innovative and Outstanding Contributions to Medical Education. In 2008 he received the Mika Salpeter Lifetime Achievement Award.\[31\] He is inducted member of the [Reeve Foundation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_and_Dana_Reeve_Foundation "wikilink") International Research Consortium on Spinal Cord Injury.\[32\] He is a co-founder of Annexon Biosciences, Inc., a company making drugs to block neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases.\[33\] He is member and elected Fellow of the [American Association for the Advancement of Science](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science "wikilink") in 2011.\[34\] In 2013 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences,\[35\] becoming the first openly transgender member.\[36\] Along with biochemist [Tom Jessell](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jessell "wikilink"), he was awarded the [Ralph W. Gerard](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_W._Gerard "wikilink") Prize in Neuroscience at the [Society for Neuroscience](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Neuroscience "wikilink") (SfN) 2016 conference in San Diego.\[37\]

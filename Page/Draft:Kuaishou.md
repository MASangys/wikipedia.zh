This phenomenon of youth marriage and pregnancy instantly got into the spotlight and caused heated debate online. In October 31, Kuaishou responded that the platform already delete videos about this kind of unmarried pregnancy\[6\]. For cases which the poster claimed to be under the age of 14, the platform cooperated with related government departments, and as to protect minors' rights such as privacy, related information were not released to the public\[7\].

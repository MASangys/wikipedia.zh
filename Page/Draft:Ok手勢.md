**OK** or **ring gesture**
([Unicode](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "wikilink") symbol
U+1F44C "👌") is performed by connecting the
[thumb](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/拇指 "wikilink") and [index
finger](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/食指 "wikilink") into a circle, and
holding the other fingers straight or relaxed away from the palm.
Commonly used by divers, it signifies "I am OK" or "Are you OK?" when
underwater. In most [English-speaking
countries](../Page/英语世界.md "wikilink") it denotes approval,
agreement, and that all is well or "[okay](../Page/OK.md "wikilink")".
In other contexts or cultures, this same gesture may have different
meanings or connotations, including many that are negative, offensive,
financial, numerical, devotional, or purely
[linguistic](../Page/语言学.md "wikilink").

## Positive connotations

### Classical use

[Buddha_dvaravatistyle.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Buddha_dvaravatistyle.jpg "fig:Buddha_dvaravatistyle.jpg")
statue in [Thailand](../Page/泰国.md "wikilink") depicting the gesture as
*[Vitarka Mudrā](../Page/手印.md "wikilink")*\]\] Ring gestures, formed by
forefinger and thumb with remaining digits extended, appear in Greece at
least as early as the fifth century BCE, and can be seen on [painted
vases](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/古希腊陶器 "wikilink") as an expression
of love, with thumb and forefinger mimicking
[kissing](../Page/親吻.md "wikilink") lips. When proffered by one
person toward another in [Ancient Greece](../Page/古希腊.md "wikilink"),
the gesture was of one professing their love for another, and the
sentiment was conveyed more in the touching of fingertips than in the
ring that they formed.\[1\] As an expression of assent and approval, the
gesture can be traced back to first century
[Rome](../Page/羅馬帝國.md "wikilink") where the
[rhetorician](../Page/修辞学.md "wikilink")
[Quintilian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/昆提利安 "wikilink") is recorded
as having used it.\[2\] Quintilian's ** prescribed variations in context
for the gesture's use during specific points of a speech: to open, give
warning or praise or accusation, and then to close a .\[3\]

Contemporaneously the sign appeared throughout the
[Buddhist](../Page/佛教.md "wikilink") and
[Hindu](../Page/印度教.md "wikilink") diasporas as a symbol of inner
perfection. [Ethologist](../Page/动物行为学.md "wikilink") [Desmond
Morris](../Page/德斯蒙德·莫利斯.md "wikilink") posits that the joined
thumb-and-forefinger communicates precision in grasping something
literally or figuratively, and that the shape formed by their union
represents the epitome of perfection—a
[circle](../Page/圆.md "wikilink")—hence the gesture's transcultural
message that things are "exactly right" or "perfect".\[4\]

In [Naples](../Page/那不勒斯.md "wikilink") the gesture has been long used
to symbolize love and [matrimony](../Page/婚姻.md "wikilink"), as was
custom in neighboring [Greece](../Page/希腊.md "wikilink"), but
specifically with the palm upturned, while the gesture made with a
downturned palm represents a hand holding the [scales of
justice](../Page/正义女神.md "wikilink").\[5\]\[6\] Across
[Italy](../Page/意大利.md "wikilink") the gesture remained in use as
one for making points in conversation when moved about to express
discursive precision, but when held still in an upright position with
fingers jutting skyward, it became an emblem of perfection.\[7\]

Early records of the sign's usage in the English-speaking world date to
British physician-philospher 's 1644 *Chirologia*, "The naturall
language of the hand composed of the speaking motions, and discoursing
gestures thereof."\[8\] Among the many hand gestures detailed by Bulwer,
he described one as "The top of the fore-finger moved to joyne with the
naile of the Thumbe that's next to it, the other fingers in
remitter,"\[9\] and said that it was "opportune for those who relate,
distinguish, or approve".\[10\]

### "OK"

[Uncle_Sam_OK.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Uncle_Sam_OK.jpg "fig:Uncle_Sam_OK.jpg")
making the "OK" gesture in a cartoon for the [1900 Paris
Exposition](../Page/1900年世界博览会.md "wikilink")\]\] By the early 19th
century in the United States, the gesture was affiliated with the
letters "[O](../Page/O.md "wikilink")" (formed by the circle) and
"[K](../Page/K.md "wikilink")" (derived from the extended fingers).
While it is not known exactly how the OK gesture and the corresponding
verbal expression coalesced, the English professor  dates the
expression's rise in usage to an 1839 humor piece in the ** describing
the expression "o.k." as meaning "all correct," suggesting comically
misspelled initials, at a time when
[acronyms](../Page/首字母縮略字.md "wikilink") for misspelled
words were in vogue.\[11\] Several other
[broadsheets](../Page/大报.md "wikilink") in
[Boston](../Page/波士顿.md "wikilink"), [New
York](../Page/纽约.md "wikilink") and
[Philadelphia](../Page/費城.md "wikilink") ran with the expression in
their own columns, some with misspellings of "all correct" such as *oll
korrect*, bringing the phrase into the vernacular of [American
English](../Page/美国英语.md "wikilink").\[12\]

The following year [Democrats](../Page/民主党_\(美国\).md "wikilink") took to
using the phrase and its accompanying gesture in support of president
[Martin Van Buren](../Page/马丁·范布伦.md "wikilink")'s [campaign for
reelection](../Page/1840年美国总统选举.md "wikilink"). A native of [Kinderhook,
New York](../Page/金德胡克.md "wikilink"), Van Buren was widely known by his
nickname, "Old Kinderhook", whose initials, "O.K.", were steadily
gaining traction as an expression of approval.\[13\] In New York City,
fans of Van Buren formed the O.K. Democratic Club and used the gesture
as its sign, with the slogan of "O.K." bearing the double meaning in the
club's catchphrase, "Old Kinderhook is all correct."\[14\] Both phrase
and gesture made their way into newspapers around the country via
political cartoons, thus further spreading the expression. After Van
Buren's defeat to [William Henry
Harrison](../Page/威廉·亨利·哈里森.md "wikilink"), O.K. was
briefly satirized as meaning "Ofrul Kalamity" or "Orful
Katastrophe".\[15\]

Despite Van Buren's loss and the subsequent dissolution of the O.K.
Democratic Club, the gesture has since been widely used since to mean
"all is well" or "good" in the United States.\[16\]\[17\] As a gesture,
its connotation is more positive than the word "OK," which may mean a
thing is merely satisfactory or mediocre, as in, "The food was OK." The
gesture is commonly understood as a signal of approval,\[18\] and is
sometimes used synonymously with the
[Western](../Page/西方世界.md "wikilink") "[thumbs
up](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/拇指手勢 "wikilink")" gesture.

### Underwater diving

In the  used by [scuba](../Page/水肺潛水.md "wikilink") divers, the OK sign
is specific in its meaning that "everything is OK" as regulated by the .
Divers are taught to always use this sign and not the [thumbs
up](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/拇指手勢 "wikilink") gesture because the
latter means that a diver needs to ascend.\[19\] The gesture is also
used as a means of checking in, with one diver using it to ask another,
"Everything OK?" and the response meaning, "Yes, everything is
OK."\[20\]

At distances where the standard OK gesture may be hard to see, divers
use larger signals as an alternative, either with one hand atop the head
and the elbow bent out to the side, or with both hands touching above
the head so that the arms form an "O" for "OK".\[21\] This full-body
gesture is also used as "OK" in Japan where the single-handed gesture
connotes monetary transactions instead of meaning "OK".\[22\] This
two-armed OK gesture was added to
[Unicode](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "wikilink") in 2010
under the name "Face With OK Gesture" (U+1F646 "🙆") and became part of
[Emoji 1.0](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji_1.0 "wikilink") in
2015.\[23\]

### Money

[211-04_she_is_pretty_rich.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:211-04_she_is_pretty_rich.jpg "fig:211-04_she_is_pretty_rich.jpg")
In Japan, the one-handed ring gesture is used to symbolize money,\[24\]
and in this context the fingers' circular shape represents a
[coin](../Page/硬幣.md "wikilink").\[25\] Sometimes the sign is used to
avoid the verbal awkwardness in talking about or asking for money.\[26\]
In other contexts, it can be used to imply a bribe or other illicit
financial transactions,\[27\]\[28\] or signal an invitation to enter
into business negotiations.\[29\]

In other parts of the world the gesture can also express money,
financial transactions, wealth or the priciness of an item. Records of
the gesture being used to remark on a person's wealth or status are
documented as practiced in [Mexico](../Page/墨西哥.md "wikilink") during
the late nineteenth century.\[30\]

### Mudra

[VitarkaMudra.JPG](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VitarkaMudra.JPG "fig:VitarkaMudra.JPG"),
[Tarim Basin](../Page/塔里木盆地.md "wikilink"), 9th century\]\] In
[yoga](../Page/瑜伽.md "wikilink") the gesture is known as *chin mudra*
("the seal of consciousness") when the palm is face down, or *jnana
mudra* ("the seal of wisdom") when the palm is face up or held in other
positions, such as in front of the [heart](../Page/心臟.md "wikilink").
Some schools of yoga use *chin* and *jnana mudra* interchangeably, while
others claim that "the former produces a subtle feeling of rootedness,
the latter a sense of lightness,"\[31\] or that *jnana* "the passive
receiving position" while *chin* "is an actively giving position".\[32\]
In these mudras the middle, ring, and little fingers represent the three
[gunas](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/三特质 "wikilink") of *rajas*,
*tamas*, and *sattva* which, when in harmony, unite
*[ātman](../Page/我_\(印度教\).md "wikilink")* and
*[brahman](../Page/梵.md "wikilink")*, or the individual soul and
universal soul. The pressing together of the thumb and forefinger
represents that union—or "yoga"—of consciousness.\[33\] In
[Buddhism](../Page/佛教.md "wikilink") the gesture is called [vitarka
mudra](../Page/手印.md "wikilink") ("the seal of discussion") and is used
to emphasize the meaning of words.\[34\]

## Negative connotations

### Cultural contexts

[OK-negative.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OK-negative.jpg "fig:OK-negative.jpg")

While widespread use of the OK gesture has granted it an international
connotation of assent, it also bears negative, vulgar, or offensive
meanings in many regions of the world.\[35\] In contrast to Japan's use
of the expression to represent coins and wealth, the gesture's "O" shape
stands for "zero" meaning "worth nothing" in France and
Tunisia.\[36\]\[37\] In many Mediterranean countries such as Turkey,
Tunisia, and Greece, as well as in the Middle East, parts of Germany,
and several South American countries, including Argentina, Chile, El
Salvador and Mexico, the gesture may be interpreted as a vulgar
expression resembling a human [anus](../Page/肛门.md "wikilink"),
referring to sex, either as an insult ("You are an
[asshole](../Page/Asshole.md "wikilink")"), or an offensive reference to
[homosexuality](../Page/同性戀.md "wikilink") and the act of
[sodomy](../Page/鸡奸.md "wikilink").\[38\] In Brazil it can be
[synonymous](../Page/同义词.md "wikilink") with giving someone [the middle
finger](../Page/豎中指.md "wikilink").\[39\]\[40\]

In [Kuwait](../Page/科威特.md "wikilink") and other parts of the [Arab
world](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/阿拉伯世界 "wikilink"), this sign
represents the [evil eye](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/邪眼 "wikilink")
and is used as a curse, sometimes in conjunction with verbal
condemnation.\[41\]\[42\]\[43\]

In some regions of the world, both the positive "OK" and the negative
forms are practiced, which can lead to confusion over which meaning is
intended.\[44\] In regions and cultures where the gesture has a
historically negative connotation, its use as an "OK sign" is often the
result of its appearance in media and tends to be used more by younger
people.\[45\] In France, where widespread use has seeped in through
[American culture](../Page/美国文化.md "wikilink"), the gesture's positive
"OK" sentiment became popular in the north of the country while its
negative connotation as "worthless" remained in the south. To avoid
confusion, French communicators have become accustomed to using
additional context clues, such as posture or facial expression, to
clarify meaning.\[46\] In other circumstances, the gesture's varied
meanings are less easily reconciled, as was the case in 1950s Brazil
when [United States Vice President](../Page/美国副总统.md "wikilink")
[Richard Nixon](../Page/理查德·尼克松.md "wikilink") emerged from his airplane
displaying the sign with each hand.\[47\] While Nixon's intent was to
communicate good will to the people of [São
Paulo](../Page/聖保羅_\(巴西\).md "wikilink"), the crowd received
it with offense.\[48\]

### The circle game

[Tondo.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tondo.jpg "fig:Tondo.jpg")
Since the 1980s, the OK gesture has been the key feature of the popular
, "". A person initiating the game makes the gesture below their own
waistline and tries to trick an opponent into looking at it. If the
person looks at it, the maker of the gesture punches the opponent in the
arm.\[49\] Variations exist where a player who can insert their own
index finger into the circle without looking at it may punch the
circle-maker.\[50\] In November 2000, the gesture gained widespread use
when the circle game was a plot feature in an episode of the sitcom
*[Malcolm in the Middle](../Page/左右做人难.md "wikilink")*.\[51\]

### White supremacy prank

In 2017, the OK gesture was at the center of an online prank in [meme
culture](../Page/網路爆紅事物.md "wikilink") related to
[alt-right](../Page/另类右派.md "wikilink") and [white
supremacy](../Page/白人優越主義.md "wikilink") originating from anonymous
[message board](../Page/网络论坛.md "wikilink") posts on the website
[4chan](../Page/4chan.md "wikilink").\[52\] *[The Boston
Globe](../Page/波士頓環球報.md "wikilink")* reported that users on 4chan's
board were instructed in February 2017 to "flood
[Twitter](../Page/Twitter.md "wikilink") and other social media
websites...claiming that the OK hand sign is a symbol of white
supremacy," as part of a campaign dubbed "Operation O-KKK".\[53\] The
association of the gesture with white supremacy derived from the
assertion that the three upheld fingers resemble a 'W' and the circle
made with the thumb and forefinger resemble the head of a 'P', together
standing for "white power".\[54\] While some members of the alt-right
used the symbol after the launch of the 4chan campaign, it remained
ambiguous whether or not it was being used to communicate genuine
adherence to white supremacy, or with deliberately
[ironic](../Page/反諷.md "wikilink") motives.\[55\] In May 2017, the
[Anti-Defamation League](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/反誹謗聯盟 "wikilink")
published an article asking:

> Has the simple thumb-and-forefinger 'OK' hand gesture become a common
> white supremacist hand sign? Not quite, but it has become a popular
> gesture used by people across several segments of the right and far
> right—including some actual white supremacists—who generally use it to
> trigger reactions. \[...\] Only if the gesture occurs in context with
> other clear indicators of white supremacy can one draw that
> conclusion.\[56\]

By 2018, a number of people were accused of signaling support for white
supremacist ideology in publicly displaying the
gesture.\[57\]\[58\]\[59\]\[60\] For example, the [U.S. Coast
Guard](../Page/美国海岸警卫队.md "wikilink") disciplined an employee who
conspicuously made this gesture in the background of a newscast in
September 2018.\[61\]\[62\] In March 2019, Idaho Lt. Governor  received
considerable criticism for posing with members of the  right-wing
militia group outside of her office who made the
gesture.\[63\]\[64\]\[65\] In March 2019, [Brenton
Tarrant](../Page/基督城清真寺槍擊案.md "wikilink") flashed the sign to
cameras in a [New Zealand](../Page/新西兰.md "wikilink") courtroom during
his arraignment for the fatal shooting of 50 people at two mosques in
[Christchurch](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings "wikilink").\[66\]
In May 2019 a [Chicago Cubs](../Page/芝加哥小熊.md "wikilink") fan was banned
from [Wrigley Field](../Page/瑞格利球场.md "wikilink") for using the gesture
behind  during a TV report.\[67\] In May 2019, Chicago's  spent $53,000
to reprint its yearbook after 18 students flashed the gesture in
pictures. Officials stated that the symbol's increasing association with
white supremacy could jeopardize the students' reputations and future
college and job prospects, they would be removing the photographs from
the yearbook in its reprinted form. \[68\]

## Sign language

Most sign languages combine hand shapes, movement, and position in
relation to the rest of body, as well as additional [body
language](../Page/肢体语言.md "wikilink") and facial expression. As with
other hand signs, the OK gesture may be combined with other elements to
convey numerous meanings across multiple sign languages.

### Monastic signing

Dating back to the tenth century in Europe, the gesture of thumb and
forefinger forming a ring with the remaining fingers extended was used
in  employed by [Christian](../Page/基督教.md "wikilink") monks under  to
represent numerous religious rites and objects. For example, when held
out in front of oneself the gesture represented an  to God. When touched
to the mouth it meant taking a meal. When added to the open-palmed sign
for "book" it specified a , and the sign's O-shape represented the
signing of an "O" that began many
[hymns](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/讚美詩 "wikilink"). If the thumb
and forefinger took hold of a specific part of one's own clothing or
body such as the hood of a , a lock of hair, or skin on the left hand,
the gesture could stand for things as diverse as "monk" or "horse" or
"parchment".\[69\]

### Plains Indian Sign Language

In [North American](../Page/北美洲.md "wikilink")  (PISL), the gesture
signifies the Sun when held up in front of the face or moved in an arc
following the Sun's track. When held up to the sky and peered through,
it is the sign for [high
noon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中午 "wikilink").\[70\] A PISL
primer printed in an 1888 issue of the [Canadian residential
school](../Page/加拿大印地安人寄宿學校系統.md "wikilink") newspaper *Our Forest
Children* specifies that the left hand be used to indicate sunrise and
the right for sunset.\[71\] A more complicated series of movements with
hands held in the gesture as if drawing a thread or stretching an
elastic can signify death, or more specifically, "After a long time, you
die."\[72\]

### American Sign Language

In modern-day [American Sign Language](../Page/美國手語.md "wikilink") (ASL)
the gesture can mean many different things depending on how it is
applied. The pinching action of the thumb-and-forefinger frequently
represents something small. For example, the sign for
"[housefly](../Page/家蠅.md "wikilink")" is made by making the gesture
mimic a fly buzzing around.\[73\] In ASL the gesture can also
communicate a selection of some sort: When moved from one side to the
other as if picking something up and placing it down, it means
"appoint". When the joined thumb and forefinger of the gesture are
placed into a hole made by the opposite hand, it means "vote". The sign
for "elect" is formed by making the signs for "vote" and "appoint" in
succession.\[74\]

### Fingerspelling

[Sign_language_F.svg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sign_language_F.svg "fig:Sign_language_F.svg")
in the [American manual alphabet](../Page/美國手語字母.md "wikilink")\]\]

In [deaf culture](../Page/聋人文化.md "wikilink"), the
[sign](../Page/手語.md "wikilink") of joined thumb and forefinger
takes on various letters in different systems of
[fingerspelling](../Page/手語拼寫法.md "wikilink"). The [American manual
alphabet](../Page/美國手語字母.md "wikilink") reserves it for the letter
[F](../Page/F.md "wikilink"), while in both
[Irish](../Page/愛爾蘭手語.md "wikilink") and  it is the letter
[G](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/G "wikilink").\[75\] In
fingerspellings that represent [Cyrillic
alphabetical](../Page/西里尔字母.md "wikilink") systems, such as
the , the gesture represents the [vowel](../Page/元音.md "wikilink")
[O](../Page/O.md "wikilink") and reflects that letter's shape.\[76\]
Similarly, the  uses the gesture for the
[Hangul](../Page/諺文.md "wikilink") letter
"[ㅇ](../Page/ㅇ.md "wikilink")", romanized as "ng" to reflect its
pronunciation in [spoken Korean](../Page/朝鮮語.md "wikilink").\[77\] In
*yubimoji* (指文字 ),  whose 45 signs and four
[diacritics](../Page/附加符号.md "wikilink") represent the
[phonemes](../Page/音位.md "wikilink") of the [Japanese
language](../Page/日语.md "wikilink"), the gesture is the
[syllable](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/音节 "wikilink")
"*[me](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/め "wikilink")*" (め in
[hiragana](../Page/平假名.md "wikilink"), メ in
[katakana](../Page/片假名.md "wikilink")).\[78\] Various
fingerspelling systems may call for other specific features of the
gesture beyond its joined thumb-and-forefinger with remaining fingers
entended. For example, the ring in yubimoji's "me" gesture is slightly
tapered rather than rounded.\[79\]

### Counting

[Chinese_number_three.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chinese_number_three.jpg "fig:Chinese_number_three.jpg")"
in [Chinese number gestures](../Page/数字手势.md "wikilink")\]\]

In American Sign Language the OK gesture represents the number
[9](../Page/9.md "wikilink") when held in a stationary position with the
palm facing away from the signer.\[80\] This ASL numerical sign is the
last in a sequence of single-digit [integers](../Page/整数.md "wikilink")
where quantities of fingers denote the numbers
[1](../Page/1.md "wikilink") through [5](../Page/5.md "wikilink"), and
then the thumb touches each finger in turn to denote
[6](../Page/6.md "wikilink") (pinky finger),
[7](../Page/7.md "wikilink") (ring finger), [8](../Page/8.md "wikilink")
(middle finger), and finally 9 (index finger). When shaken from left to
right the sign for the number 9 becomes the number
[19](../Page/19.md "wikilink").\[81\]

In Plains Indian Sign Language the gesture signifies the number
[3](../Page/3.md "wikilink") when held a bit lower than the signs used
to represent the sun.\[82\] Regional forms of [finger counting used in
China](../Page/数字手势.md "wikilink") also employ the raised middle, ring
and pinky fingers to express the number 3, either with thumb and index
fingers joined as they are in the OK gesture or in a similar
configuration.\[83\] This number gesture is primarily used in China's
southern provinces, while in the north 3 may also be expressed by the
raised index, middle, and ring fingers as it is in English-speaking
countries.\[84\] Both methods are distinct from having the thumb, index
and middle fingers extended as is used to denote 3 in much of mainland
Europe,\[85\] because this represents the number 8 in both
[Taiwan](../Page/中華民國.md "wikilink") and parts of mainland
[China](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中华人民共和国 "wikilink").\[86\]

Greco-Roman ** also included a counting system in which the ring gesture
stood for either [10](../Page/10.md "wikilink"),
[30](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/30 "wikilink"),
[100](../Page/100.md "wikilink"), or [300](../Page/300.md "wikilink"),
the exact number being determined by which hand was used and the exact
point of contact between thumb and forefinger.\[87\]

## Popular culture

### The Prisoner

The gesture was given prominence in the 1967 British television series
*[The Prisoner](../Page/密諜.md "wikilink")*, in which a number of unnamed
characters are held captive in .\[88\] Whenever these imprisoned
villagers would take leave of each other, they did so with the phrase
"Be seeing you", accompanied by the gesture held up in front of their
own eye as a reminder that despite any pretenses of freedom, they were
all prisoners.\[89\] The gesture is also used as a greeting in the show
without the "be seeing you" phrase. The series' lead actor  stated that
the show had adopted the gesture from the [sign of the
fish](../Page/耶穌魚.md "wikilink") used by early
Christians.\[90\]\[91\]

### As a film title

In 2010, [South Indian](../Page/印度南部.md "wikilink") film director  made
a cinematic comeback with a film that fans called **, but whose actual
title was *👌*.\[92\] Rao himself starred in his film as a [non-resident
Indian](../Page/海外印度人.md "wikilink") who returns to his homeland to turn
the nation into a [utopian](../Page/乌托邦.md "wikilink") society.\[93\] In
depicting the film's title only as a hand symbol, Rao's intent was for
the audience to name it, thinking that they might call it "Zero" or
"Three," or associate it with Vitarka Mudra or the symbol for
*[om](../Page/唵.md "wikilink")* (ॐ).\[94\] During the film's opening
credit sequence, the Vitarka Mudra title transforms into a hand pointing
at the viewer announcing the name of the director as "U".\[95\]

## Other connotations

### Political affiliations

In Europe's [Balkan](../Page/巴尔干半岛.md "wikilink") region the OK gesture
is known as the [United Macedonia](../Page/统一马其顿.md "wikilink") Salute
in its association with [irredentist](../Page/领土收复主义.md "wikilink")
campaigns for a united Macedonia.\[96\] For
[Macedonian](../Page/馬其頓.md "wikilink") nationalists the two
fingers forming the "O" stand for the Macedonian word *Обединета*
(*Obedineta*, meaning "United"), and the other three fingers symbolize
the regions of  in northern [Greece](../Page/希腊.md "wikilink"),  in
southwestern [Bulgaria](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/保加利亚 "wikilink"),
and the region of [Vardar Macedonia](../Page/瓦尔达尔马其顿.md "wikilink") that
roughly corresponds to the [Republic of North
Macedonia](../Page/北馬其頓.md "wikilink")'s 21st century
borders.\[97\] Taken together, the United Macedonia Salute also
resembles the [Vergina Sun](../Page/维吉纳太阳.md "wikilink") that was the
royal symbol of [Ancient Macedonia](../Page/馬其頓王國.md "wikilink"). Both
Sun and Salute became popular among  in the 1980s, and the Sun appeared
on the  after the Republic of Macedonia declared independence from
[Yugoslavia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/南斯拉夫 "wikilink") in 1992.
Three years later Macedonia changed its flag under [economic
pressure](../Page/經濟制裁.md "wikilink") from Greece, which saw the use of
the Vergina Sun as a threat against Greek sovereignty. The United
Macedonia Salute remains controversial among many people in the Balkan
region, especially those living within parts of Greece or Bulgaria that
Macedonian nationalists wish to claim as provinces for the
Republic.\[98\]

### Occult

The gesture has been known as "the feminine hand" and was once
associated with female genitalia.\[99\] It has also been used to
represent the number
[666](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/666年 "wikilink") as the [Number of
the Beast](../Page/獸名數目.md "wikilink") with the three sixes all sharing
the circle formed by the index finger and thumb while the other three
fingers form their individual ascenders.\[100\] In
[Satanism](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/撒旦崇拜 "wikilink") the three
fingers also represent the three aspects of the "Unholy Trinity" of the
Sun God [Lucifer](../Page/路西法.md "wikilink"), the [Mother
Goddess](../Page/地母神.md "wikilink"), and their offspring, the
[Antichrist](../Page/敌基督.md "wikilink"). In
[Freemasonry](../Page/共济会.md "wikilink") the hand sign also
signifies the deity of the Sun and the Masonic pursuit for light.\[101\]

### Medical testing

The gesture is used by doctors to test functionality of the  and seek
indications of  in the hands. When performing the test, a patient makes
the OK gesture with both hands. If the circle formed by one hand appears
more pinched or less round than the other, it may indicate weakness in
the nerve.\[102\]\[103\]

A similar medical test, known as , is used to test for  on the . To
perform the test, a patient holds a piece of paper between their
forefinger and thumb, and the examiner attempts to pull it out of the
patient's grip.\[104\] If ulnar nerve palsy is present, the patient will
have difficulty maintaining their hold and may compensate by flexing the
thumb to add more pressure.\[105\]

### Corporate logos

The gesture has been used as a design element in several corporate and
organizational [logos](../Page/标志.md "wikilink"). These include the , ,
and  Studios, all headquartered in India.\[106\] Piramal Group CEO Ajay
Piramal told the press that "The Group's values are rooted in tradition.
They have been derived from three guiding principles in the *[Bhagavad
Gita](../Page/薄伽梵譚.md "wikilink")*:  (the principle of knowledge and
learning),  (the principle of dynamic action and entrepreneurial spirit)
and  (the principle of care, compassion and devotion to a higher
purpose)." Piramal stated that the three fingers in the logo symbolize
the mind, the body and the intellect in alignment with the Group's core
values of "Knowledge, Action and Care" that subtitle the corporation's
logo.\[107\] In contrast to this, Bharat Petroleum began using the OK
gesture as its own logo in 2002 with its "Pure for Sure" initiative to
indicate that petrol filling stations and trucks transporting gasoline
had been audited and approved as selling pure, undiluted fuel, and that
customers could trust that what they were buying had been
"okayed".\[108\]

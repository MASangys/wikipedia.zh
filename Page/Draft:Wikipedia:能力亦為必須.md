维基百科是个大地方，有许多编辑者，对于如何做事，每个人都有自己的观点。很惊讶我们居然能一起工作，然而不知怎么，这是常有的事。

我们维基百科的核心指导原则之一，促进了这种工作，那就是“[善意推定](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AGF "wikilink")”。这是一个好建议，它提醒我们当大家意见相左时，每个与之相关的人（通常）都会选择自认为最好的做法。当然，也会有人[“故意”破坏项目](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:_VANDAL "wikilink")，但他们很好对付，如果需要，他们就会被[禁止编辑](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLOCK "wikilink")，这不费吹灰之力，而且通常毫无争议。

较大的争议通常存在于这种情况：编辑者试图帮忙，但造成了[扰乱](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:DISRUPT "wikilink")，他们无意如此并且常常不知不觉。这就是我们在践行善意推定理念时（这通常很有用），意外带来的副作用。许多编辑者过于关注这个原则，他们相信，對於贡献者的要求就只有善意而已。不幸的是，事情完全不是如此。**能力亦为必须**。出于好心造成的混乱，依旧是混乱。

毫无疑问，每个编辑者在一些特定的领域，都未必能完全胜任。有些编辑者可能對於[原子核物理学](../Page/原子核物理学.md "wikilink")很熟悉，但對[芭蕾舞](../Page/芭蕾舞.md "wikilink")完全沒有概念，因此知道或找到你自己的局限是很重要的。

## 与善意相比

“假设人们试图帮忙”看起来并不重要——但是如果有人缺乏能力，或者是有时帮上忙，有时造成破坏，那么他们的编辑可能会让整个项目产生不可挽回的损失。正如俗语所云，好心却可能办了坏事。我们必须将项目视为一个整体，这胜过将之视为任何编辑者的贡献。

所以如果下次有人发布告说：“编辑者 XXX 造成了问题——下面列举证明”，或者是“破坏分子 XXX 正申请解封”，请在“善意推定”之前三思。投诉的人已经做过善意推定了，而且那些人是被视为缺乏能力，而不是缺乏善意。有用的编辑同时需要能力和善意。如果已经证实，一个造成了破坏的编辑者缺乏能力，那么善意再多，也无法解决他的无能带来的问题。

## Some common types

  -
    Most of us were pretty incompetent at editing Wikipedia when we started. We might not have understood wikicode, we might not have [signed our posts](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SIGN "wikilink"), or we may not have fully appreciated exactly [which sources are reliable](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:RS "wikilink"). The great thing about this situation is that *it's easily fixable*. [Help the newbies understand what we do here](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:HD "wikilink"), and soon they'll be making themselves useful. Further information: [Wikipedia:Do not bite the newcomers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Do_not_bite_the_newcomers "wikilink").
  -
    The best good will is for naught if a basic understanding of the facts, their mainstream interpretation, and their cultural context are lacking.
  -
    Some people just can't function well in this particular collaborative environment. We can't change Wikipedia to suit them, so if they're unable to change themselves, they'll need to be shown the door politely but firmly.
    Some behavioral issues and personality traits may be correlated with the inability to collaborate civilly in an environment in which such collaboration is essential. The Wikipedia community assesses editors solely on the basis of their actions within Wikipedia. Blocking an editor who has demonstrated that they are unable to participate in Wikipedia is not discrimination on the basis of disability (if one exists), even if that disability contributes to their failure to participate. [Wikipedia is not therapy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_therapy "wikilink").
  -
    Some editors hold personal opinions so strongly that they cannot edit neutrally and collaboratively with other editors. If this continues to be disruptive and a user is unable to step away from topics where they have strong biases, a [topic ban](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Topic_ban "wikilink") is generally appropriate. Try this first before going for a site ban, because some people can make valuable contributions in places *other* than their pet topic. It is often very difficult to see one's own biased editing, though it is easy to see that of others.
  -
    If someone's native language is [not English](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_second_or_foreign_language "wikilink") and they may not be able to communicate in English well—including discussing things with other editors—consider trying to encourage them to edit a Wikipedia in their own language. Those other-language Wikipedias need help from editors too.
    There is also the problem of editors whose command of English is sufficient for colloquial use, and who can make themselves understood on talk pages and in other informal circumstances, but who do not write sufficiently well in English that their contributions to *articles* are acceptable. These editors could also be encouraged to edit the Wikipedia of their native language or other languages they are more conversant with, and to limit their contributions on English Wikipedia articles to edits that do not require writing in English or to work with native speakers to improve their contributions.
  -
    Some people aren't able to grasp the subtleties of how Wikipedia works. They may still be able to do some easy jobs, but they'll probably run into trouble if they try biting off too much. Encourage them to keep to the simple things, or suggest a break if they're getting frustrated about their edits getting reverted or getting into contentious interactions with other editors.
  -
    Insufficient technical knowledge is not usually a problem, unless when adding, deleting, or changing technical content. Not everyone needs the same skill set—and as long as people operate only where they're capable, differences in skill sets are not a problem.
  -
    Some people get so upset over a past dispute that they look at everything through a lens of "So-and-so is a bad editor and is out to get me." [Taken to extremes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOTBATTLEGROUND "wikilink"), this easily becomes quite disruptive. An [enforced parole](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:IBAN "wikilink") of "don't interact with this other editor" may be something to try in these cases.
  -
    Some enthusiastic new editors combine multiple diverse article changes into one large edit or rapid series of edits. If reverted, at the [talk page](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:TPG "wikilink") they start talking about everything at once, which renders methodical progress impossible. Try asking these editors to present their desired changes, their reasoning, and their [reliable sources](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:RS "wikilink") for just one paragraph at a time, or for just one paragraph per subsection heading. Those editors who are capable of [collaboration](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/collaboration "wikilink")—a necessary skill to edit Wikipedia—will understand and appreciate the advice. Those who continue to talk about everything at once probably lack the required ability to collaborate.

## What "Competence is required" does <u>not</u> mean

  - It does not mean "[come down hard like a ton of bricks on someone as soon as they make a mistake](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BRICKS "wikilink")." Wikipedia has a learning curve. We should cut editors (particularly new ones) some slack, and help them understand how to edit competently. Mistakes are an inevitable part of the wiki process.
  - It does not mean perfection is required. Articles can be improved in small steps, rather than being made perfect in one fell swoop. Small improvements are our bread and butter.
  - It does not mean we should ignore people and not try to help improve their competence.
  - It does not mean we should label people as incompetent. For example, we do not say "You are incompetent because you don't know anything about the subject of this article."
  - It does not mean that Wikipedia's [civility policy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility "wikilink") does not apply when talking to incompetent people. Rude and uncivil comments may discourage the motivation of the targeted editor, raising their psychological barrier against recognizing their own mistakes or seeking to improve their skills.
  - Finally, it does not mean we will give any good-faith editor an infinite number of opportunities to make themselves useful. If, after an appropriate amount of time and coaching, someone *still* isn't competent, don't make a heroic effort to defend them. Cut them loose, and focus your mentoring efforts on a better candidate.

## The bottom line

At the end of the day, there can be a fine line between mischief and incompetence. It doesn't help to spend too much time trying to figure out the reason for the disruption, because many trolls do their trolling by feigning incompetence. It is difficult to distinguish between fake or real incompetence, but disruption is disruption and needs to be prevented. Give editors a few chances, and some good advice, certainlybut if these things don't lead to reasonably competent editing within a reasonable time frame, it's best to wash your hands of the situation. Wikipedia, for better or worse, is just not the best fit for everybody.

## 此論述...

...常常會被批評為[不文明行為](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:文明#其他不文明行為 "wikilink")。有關此一批評，需要注意的是，此論述的主要目的不是要給能力還不足的編輯者，不是為了讓他們知道其能力的不足。畢竟，如以上所述，這些編輯者有可能無法意識到本身能力的不足 ，也有可能無法調整自身的編輯方式。此論述的主要目的是給其他編輯者，在處理可能和編輯者能力有關的議題時，適合的處理方式。因此，若WP:COMPETENCE此論述可能可以適用在在某編輯身上，一般而言不太合適將這件事直接告訴該編輯。

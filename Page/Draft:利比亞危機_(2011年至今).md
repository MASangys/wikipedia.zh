The **Libyan Crisis\[1\]\[2\]** refers to the ongoing conflicts in
[Libya](../Page/利比亚.md "wikilink"), beginning with the [Arab
Spring](../Page/阿拉伯之春.md "wikilink") protests of 2011, which led to a
[civil war](../Page/2011年利比亚内战.md "wikilink"), [foreign military
intervention](../Page/2011年多国武装干涉利比亚.md "wikilink"), and the ousting and
[death of Muammar Gaddafi](../Page/穆阿迈尔·卡扎菲之死.md "wikilink"). The civil
war's
[aftermath](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_the_2011_Libyan_Civil_War "wikilink")
and proliferation of armed groups led to [violence and
instability](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-civil_war_violence_in_Libya "wikilink")
across the country, which erupted into renewed [civil war in
2014](../Page/利比亚内战_\(2014年至今\).md "wikilink"). The ongoing crisis in
Libya has so far resulted in tens of thousands of casualties since the
onset of violence in early 2011. During both civil wars, the output of
Libya's economically crucial oil industry collapsed to a small fraction
of its usual level, with most facilities blockaded or damaged by rival
groups, despite having the largest oil reserves of any African
country.\[3\] [U.S. President](../Page/美国总统.md "wikilink") [Barack
Obama](../Page/贝拉克·奥巴马.md "wikilink") stated on 11 April 2016 that not
preparing for a post-Gaddafi Libya was probably the "worst mistake" of
his presidency.\[4\]

## Background

The history of Libya under [Muammar
Gaddafi](../Page/穆阿迈尔·卡扎菲.md "wikilink") spanned 42 years
from 1969 to 2011. Gaddafi became the *de facto* leader of the country
on 1 September 1969 after leading a group of young Libyan military
officers against [King Idris I](../Page/伊德里斯一世_\(利比亞\).md "wikilink") in
a [nonviolent
revolution](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonviolent_revolution "wikilink")
and bloodless [coup d'état](../Page/政變.md "wikilink"). After the king
had fled the country, the [Libyan Revolutionary Command
Council](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Revolutionary_Command_Council "wikilink")
(RCC) headed by Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and the old constitution
and proclaimed the new Libyan Arab Republic, with the motto "freedom,
socialism, and unity".\[5\]

After coming to power, the RCC government took control of all petroleum
companies operating in the country and initiated a process of directing
funds toward providing education, health care and housing for all.
Despite the reforms not being entirely effective, public education in
the country became free and primary education compulsory for both sexes.
Medical care became available to the public at no cost, but providing
housing for all was a task that the government was not able to
complete.\[6\] Under Gaddafi, per capita income in the country rose to
more than US$11,000, the fifth-highest in Africa.\[7\] The increase in
prosperity was accompanied by a controversial foreign policy and
increased political repression at home.\[8\]\[9\]

## Events

### First civil war

In early 2011, a [civil war](../Page/2011年利比亚内战.md "wikilink") broke out
in the context of the wider "[Arab
Spring](../Page/阿拉伯之春.md "wikilink")". The [anti-Gaddafi
forces](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-Gaddafi_forces "wikilink")
formed a committee named the [National Transitional
Council](../Page/全国过渡委员会.md "wikilink"), on 27 February 2011. It
was meant to act as an interim authority in the rebel-controlled areas.
After the government began to roll back the rebels and a number of
atrocities were committed by both sides,\[10\]\[11\]\[12\]\[13\]\[14\] a
[multinational coalition](../Page/2011年多国武装干涉利比亚.md "wikilink") led by
[NATO](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/北大西洋公约组织 "wikilink") forces
intervened on 21 March 2011, ostensibly\[15\] to protect civilians
against attacks by the government's forces.\[16\] Shortly thereafter,
the [International Criminal Court](../Page/国际刑事法院.md "wikilink") issued
an arrest warrant against Gaddafi and his entourage on 27 June 2011.
Gaddafi was ousted from power in the wake of the [fall of
Tripoli](../Page/的黎波里之战_\(2011年\).md "wikilink") to the rebel forces on
20 August 2011, although pockets of resistance held by forces loyal to
Gaddafi's government held out for another two months, especially in
Gaddafi's hometown of [Sirte](../Page/蘇特_\(利比亞\).md "wikilink"), which
he declared the new capital of Libya on 1 September 2011.\[17\] His
[Jamahiriya](../Page/卡扎菲治下的利比亚.md "wikilink") regime came to an end the
following month, culminating on 20 October 2011 with Sirte's capture,
NATO airstrikes against Gaddafi's escape convoy, and [his
killing](../Page/穆阿迈尔·卡扎菲之死.md "wikilink") by rebel
fighters.\[18\]\[19\]

### Post-revolution armed groups and violence

The Libyan revolution led to defected regime military members who joined
rebel forces, revolutionary brigades that defected from the Libyan Army,
post-revolutionary brigades, militias, and various other armed groups,
many composed of ordinary workers and students. Some of the armed groups
formed during the war against the regime and others evolved later for
security purposes. Some were based on tribal allegiances. The groups
formed in different parts of the country and varied considerably in
size, capability, and influence. They were not united as one body, but
they were not necessarily at odds with one another. Revolutionary
brigades accounted for the majority of skilled and experienced fighters
and weapons. Some militias evolved from criminal networks to violent
extremist gangs, quite different from the brigades seeking to provide
protection.\[20\]\[21\]

After the first Libyan civil war, violence occurred involving various
armed groups who fought against Gaddafi but refused to lay down their
arms when the war ended in October 2011. Some brigades and militias
shifted from merely delaying the surrender of their weapons to actively
asserting a continuing political role as "guardians of the revolution",
with hundreds of local armed groups filling the complex security vacuum
left by the fall of Gaddafi. Before the official end of hostilities
between loyalist and opposition forces, there were reports of sporadic
clashes between rival militias and vigilante revenge
killings.\[22\]\[23\]\[24\]

In dealing with the number of unregulated armed groups, the National
Transitional Council called for all armed groups to register and unite
under the [Ministry of
Defense](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense "wikilink"),
thus placing many armed groups on the payroll of the government.\[25\]
This gave a degree of legitimacy to many armed groups, including General
[Khalifa Haftar](../Page/哈利法·贝加斯姆·哈夫塔尔.md "wikilink") who registered his
armed group as the "[Libyan National
Army](../Page/利比亚武装力量.md "wikilink")", the same name he
used for his anti-Gaddafi forces after the 1980s [Chadian–Libyan
conflict](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadian–Libyan_conflict "wikilink").\[26\]

On 11 September 2012, militants allied with
[Al-Qaeda](../Page/基地组织.md "wikilink") attacked the [US
consulate in Benghazi](../Page/班加西事件.md "wikilink"),\[27\] killing the
US ambassador and three others. This prompted a popular outcry against
the semi-legal militias that were still operating, and resulted in the
storming of several Islamist militia bases by protesters.\[28\]\[29\] A
large-scale government crackdown followed on non-sanctioned militias,
with the Libyan Army raiding several now-illegal militias' headquarters
and ordering them to disband.\[30\] The violence eventually escalated
into the second Libyan civil war.

### Second civil war

The second Libyan civil war\[31\]\[32\] is an ongoing conflict among
rival groups seeking control of the territory of Libya. The conflict has
been mostly between the government of the [Council of
Deputies](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/国民代表大会_\(利比亚\) "wikilink") that
was [elected
democratically](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Council_of_Deputies_election,_2014 "wikilink")
in 2014 and internationally recognized as the "Libyan Government", also
known as the "[Tobruk](../Page/图卜鲁格.md "wikilink") government"; and the
rival Islamist government of the [General National
Congress](../Page/大国民议会_\(利比亚\).md "wikilink") (GNC), also
called the "[National Salvation
Government](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Salvation_Government "wikilink")",
based in the capital [Tripoli](../Page/的黎波里.md "wikilink"). In December
2015 these two factions agreed in principle to unite as the [Government
of National Accord](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/民族團結政府 "wikilink").
Although the Government of National Accord is now functioning, its
authority is still unclear as specific details acceptable to both sides
have not yet been agreed upon.

The Tobruk government, strongest in eastern Libya, has the loyalty of
Haftar's Libyan National Army and has been supported by air strikes by
[Egypt](../Page/埃及.md "wikilink") and the
[UAE](../Page/阿拉伯联合酋长国.md "wikilink").\[33\] The
Islamist government of the GNC, strongest in western Libya, rejected the
results of the 2014 election, and is led by the [Muslim
Brotherhood](../Page/穆斯林兄弟會.md "wikilink"), backed by the wider Islamist
coalition known as "[Libya
Dawn](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya_Dawn "wikilink")" and other
militias,\[34\]\[35\] and aided by [Qatar](../Page/卡塔尔.md "wikilink"),
[Sudan](../Page/苏丹共和国.md "wikilink"), and
[Turkey](../Page/土耳其.md "wikilink").\[36\]\[37\]

In addition to these, there are also smaller rival groups: the Islamist
[Shura Council of Benghazi
Revolutionaries](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shura_Council_of_Benghazi_Revolutionaries "wikilink"),
led by [Ansar al-Sharia
(Libya)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Sharia_\(Libya\) "wikilink"),
which has had the support of the GNC;\[38\] the [Islamic State of Iraq
and the Levant's (ISIL's) Libyan
provinces](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant_in_Libya "wikilink");\[39\]
as well as [Tuareg militias of
Ghat](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_militias_of_Ghat "wikilink"),
controlling desert areas in the southwest; and local forces in [Misrata
District](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/米蘇拉塔省 "wikilink"), controlling
the towns of [Bani Walid](../Page/拜尼沃利德.md "wikilink") and Tawergha. The
belligerents are coalitions of armed groups that sometimes change
sides.\[40\]

Since 2015, there have been many political developments. The [United
Nations](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/联合国 "wikilink") brokered a
[cease-fire](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/停火 "wikilink") in December
2015, and on 31 March 2016 the leaders of a new UN-supported "unity
government" arrived in Tripoli.\[41\] On 5 April, the Islamist
government in western Libya announced that it was suspending operations
and handing power to the new unity government, officially named the
"[Government of National
Accord](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/民族團結政府 "wikilink")",
although it was not yet clear whether the new arrangement would
succeed.\[42\] On 2 July, rival leaders reached an agreement to reunify
the eastern and western managements of Libya's [National Oil
Corporation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oil_Corporation "wikilink")
(NOC).\[43\] As of 22 August, the unity government still had not
received the approval of Haftar's supporters in the Tobruk
government,\[44\] and on 11 September the general boosted his political
leverage by seizing control of two key oil terminals.\[45\] Haftar and
the NOC then reached an agreement for increasing oil production and
exports,\[46\] and all nine of Libya's major oil terminals were
operating again in January 2017.\[47\]

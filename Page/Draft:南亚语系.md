The **Austroasiatic** languages , also known as **Mon–Khmer** ,\[1\] are
a large [语言系属分类](../Page/语言系属分类.md "wikilink") of
[中南半島](../Page/中南半島.md "wikilink"), also scattered
throughout [印度](../Page/印度.md "wikilink"),
[孟加拉国](../Page/孟加拉国.md "wikilink"),
[尼泊尔](../Page/尼泊尔.md "wikilink") and the southern border of
[中华人民共和国](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中华人民共和国 "wikilink"), with around
117 million speakers.\[2\] The name *Austroasiatic* comes from a
combination of the [拉丁语](../Page/拉丁语.md "wikilink") words for "South"
and "Asia", hence "South Asia". Of these languages, only
[越南语](../Page/越南语.md "wikilink"),
[高棉语](../Page/高棉语.md "wikilink"), and
[孟语](../Page/孟语.md "wikilink") have a long-established recorded
history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern
[國家語言](../Page/國家語言.md "wikilink")s (in
[越南](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/越南 "wikilink") and
[柬埔寨](../Page/柬埔寨.md "wikilink"), respectively). In
[缅甸](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/缅甸 "wikilink"), the
[佤語](../Page/佤語.md "wikilink") is the de facto official language
of [佤邦](../Page/佤邦.md "wikilink"). [桑塔利语](../Page/桑塔利语.md "wikilink") is
recognized as a regional language of India. The rest of the languages
are spoken by minority groups and have no official status.

*[民族語](../Page/民族語.md "wikilink")* identifies 168 Austroasiatic
languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps ,
which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally
been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer and
[蒙达语族](../Page/蒙达语族.md "wikilink"). However, one recent
classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and )\[3\]

The **Austroasiatic** languages , also known as **Mon–Khmer** ,\[1\] are
a large [语言系属分类](../Page/语言系属分类.md "wikilink") of
[中南半島](../Page/中南半島.md "wikilink"), also scattered
throughout [印度](../Page/印度.md "wikilink"),
[孟加拉国](../Page/孟加拉国.md "wikilink"),
[尼泊尔](../Page/尼泊尔.md "wikilink") and the southern border of
[中华人民共和国](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中华人民共和国 "wikilink"), with around
117 million speakers.\[2\] The name *Austroasiatic* comes from a
combination of the [拉丁语](../Page/拉丁语.md "wikilink") words for "South"
and "Asia", hence "South Asia". Of these languages, only
[越南语](../Page/越南语.md "wikilink"),
[高棉语](../Page/高棉语.md "wikilink"), and
[孟语](../Page/孟语.md "wikilink") have a long-established recorded
history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern
[國家語言s](../Page/國家語言.md "wikilink") (in
[越南](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/越南 "wikilink") and
[柬埔寨](../Page/柬埔寨.md "wikilink"), respectively). In
[缅甸](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/缅甸 "wikilink"), the
[佤語](../Page/佤語.md "wikilink") is the de facto official language
of [佤邦](../Page/佤邦.md "wikilink"). [桑塔利语](../Page/桑塔利语.md "wikilink") is
recognized as a regional language of India. The rest of the languages
are spoken by minority groups and have no official status.

*[民族語](../Page/民族語.md "wikilink")* identifies 168 Austroasiatic
languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps ,
which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally
been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer and
[蒙达语族](../Page/蒙达语族.md "wikilink"). However, one recent
classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and )\[3\]
while another has abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it
synonymous with the larger family.\[4\]

Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India,
Bangladesh, Nepal and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other
languages are spoken. They appear to be the extant s of Southeast Asia
(if [安达曼群岛](../Page/安达曼群岛.md "wikilink") are not included), with the
neighboring [印度-雅利安语支](../Page/印度-雅利安语支.md "wikilink"),
[壯侗語族](../Page/壯侗語族.md "wikilink"),
[苗瑶语系](../Page/苗瑶语系.md "wikilink"),
[达罗毗荼语系](../Page/达罗毗荼语系.md "wikilink"),
[南島語系](../Page/南島語系.md "wikilink"), and
[汉藏语系](../Page/汉藏语系.md "wikilink") being the result of
later migrations.\[5\]

## Typology

Regarding word structure, Austroasiatic languages are well known for
having an iambic  pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an
initial, unstressed, reduced [minor
syllable](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/minor_syllable "wikilink")
followed by a stressed, full syllable. This reduction of presyllables
has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of
the same original Proto-Austroasiatic prefixes, such as the causative
prefix, ranging from CVC syllables to consonant clusters to single
consonants. As for word formation, most Austroasiatic languages have a
variety of derivational prefixes, many have
[中綴es](../Page/中綴.md "wikilink"), but suffixes are almost
completely non-existent in most branches except Munda, and a few
specialized exceptions in other Austroasiatic branches.\[6\]

The Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having
unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of
[音區](../Page/音區.md "wikilink") contrast, either between  (normal)
voice and  (lax) voice or between modal voice and .\[7\] Languages in
the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three- or
even four-way voicing contrast.

However, some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by
evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases, such as Vietnamese,
[聲調](../Page/聲調.md "wikilink"). Vietnamese has been so heavily
influenced by Chinese that its original Austroasiatic phonological
quality is obscured and now resembles that of South Chinese languages,
whereas Khmer, which had more influence from Sanskrit, has retained a
more typically Austroasiatic structure.

## 祖语

Much work has been done on the reconstruction of  in 's *Mon–Khmer
Comparative Dictionary*. Little work has been done on the
[蒙达语族](../Page/蒙达语族.md "wikilink"), which are not well
documented. With their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon–Khmer
becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic.

Paul Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of
Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows:

|     |          |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
| \*p | \*t      | \*c | \*k | \*ʔ |
| \*b | \*d      | \*ɟ | \*ɡ |     |
| \*ɓ | \*ɗ      | \*ʄ |     |     |
| \*m | \*n      | \*ɲ | \*ŋ |     |
| \*w | \*l, \*r | \*j |     |     |
|     | \*s      |     |     | \*h |

This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for .  is better
preserved in the , which Sidwell has specialized in. Sidwell (2011)
suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle
[湄公河](../Page/湄公河.md "wikilink"), in the area of the Bahnaric and
Katuic languages (approximately where modern Laos, Thailand, and
Cambodia come together), and that the family is not as old as frequently
assumed, dating to perhaps 2000 BCE.\[8\] Peiros (2011) criticized
Sidwell's theory heavily and calls it a bunch of contradictions. He show
with his analysis that the homeland of Austroasiatic is somewhere near
the [长江](../Page/长江.md "wikilink"). He suggests the
[四川盆地](../Page/四川盆地.md "wikilink") as likely homeland of
proto-Austroasiatic before they migrated to other parts of central and
southern China and than into Southeast Asia. He further suggests that
the family must be as old as proto-Austronesian and proto-Sinotibetan or
even older.\[9\]

Georg van Driem (2011) proposes that the homeland of Austroasiatic is
somewhere in southern China. He suggests that the region around the
[珠江](../Page/珠江.md "wikilink") is the likely homeland of the
Austroasiatic languages and people. He further suggests, based on
genetic studies, that the migration of
[壯侗語族](../Page/壯侗語族.md "wikilink") people from Taiwan
replaced the original Austroasiatic language but the effect on the
people was only minor. Local Austroasiatic speakers adopted Kra-Dai
languages and partially their culture.\[10\]

The linguists Sagart (2011) and Bellwood (2013) support the theory of an
origin of Austroasiatic along the [长江](../Page/长江.md "wikilink") in
southern China.\[11\]

A genetic and linguistic research in 2015 about ancient people in East
Asia suggest an origin and homeland of Austroasiatic in today
[华南地区](../Page/华南地区.md "wikilink") or even further north.\[12\]

## 内部划分

Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of
Austroasiatic: the [南亚语系](../Page/南亚语系.md "wikilink") of
[东南亚](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/东南亚 "wikilink"),
[印度东北部](../Page/印度东北部.md "wikilink") and the
[尼科巴群岛](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/尼科巴群岛 "wikilink"), and
the [蒙达语族](../Page/蒙达语族.md "wikilink") of
[印度东部](../Page/印度东部.md "wikilink") and  and parts of
[孟加拉国](../Page/孟加拉国.md "wikilink"), parts of
[尼泊尔](../Page/尼泊尔.md "wikilink"). However, no evidence for
this classification has ever been published.

Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted
as a valid clade. By contrast, the relationships *between* these
families within Austroasiatic are debated. In addition to the
traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of
which accepts traditional "Mon–Khmer" as a valid unit. However, little
of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published,
and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.

In addition, there are suggestions that additional branches of
Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of
[亚齐语](../Page/亚齐语.md "wikilink") in Sumatra (Diffloth), the
[Chamic
languages](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamic_languages "wikilink") of
Vietnam, and the [Land Dayak
languages](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Dayak_languages "wikilink")
of Borneo (Adelaar 1995).\[13\]

### Diffloth (1974)

's widely cited original classification, now abandoned by Diffloth
himself, is used in *[大英百科全书](../Page/大英百科全书.md "wikilink")* and—except
for the breakup of Southern Mon–Khmer—in *Ethnologue.*

### Peiros (2004)

Peiros is a  classification, based on percentages of shared vocabulary.
This means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than
they actually are due to [語言接觸](../Page/語言接觸.md "wikilink"). Indeed,
when Sidwell (2009) replicated Peiros's study with languages known well
enough to account for loans, he did not find the internal (branching)
structure below.

### Diffloth (2005)

compares reconstructions of various clades, and attempts to classify
them based on shared innovations, though like other classifications the
evidence has not been published. As a schematic, we have:

This family tree is consistent with recent studies of migration of
Y-Chromosomal . However, the dates obtained from by [Zhivotovsky
method](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhivotovsky_method "wikilink") DNA
studies are several times older than that given by linguists.\[15\] The
route map of the people with haplogroup O2a1-M95, speaking this language
can be seen in this link.\[16\] Other geneticists criticise the
Zhivotovsky method.

### Previously existent branches

(2009)\[17\] also proposes that there might have been other primary
branches of Austroasiatic that are now extinct, based on  evidence in
modern-day languages.

  - **Pre- languages** (the languages of coastal Vietnam prior to the
    Chamic migrations). Chamic has various Austroasiatic loanwords that
    cannot be clearly traced to existing Austroasiatic branches (Sidwell
    2006, 2007).\[18\]\[19\] Larish (1999)\[20\] also notes that
    contain many Austroasiatic loanwords, some of which are similar to
    the ones found in Chamic.
  - **[亚齐语](../Page/亚齐语.md "wikilink") substratum** (Sidwell
    2006).\[21\] Acehnese has many basic words that are of Austroasiatic
    origin, suggesting that either Austronesian speakers have absorbed
    earlier Austroasiatic residents in northern Sumatra, or that words
    might have been borrowed from Austroasiatic languages in southern
    Vietnam – or perhaps a combination of both. Sidwell (2006) argues
    that Acehnese and Chamic had often borrowed Austroasiatic words
    independently of each other, while some Austroasiatic words can be
    traced back to Proto-Aceh-Chamic. Sidwell (2006) accepts that
    Acehnese and Chamic are related, but that they had separated from
    each other before Chamic had borrowed most of its Austroasiatic
    lexicon.
  - ** substrate languages** (Blench 2010).\[22\] Blench cites
    Austroasiatic-origin words in modern-day Bornean branches such as
    [Land
    Dayak](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Dayak_languages "wikilink")
    (, , etc.),  (, , etc.), , and , noting especially resemblances with
    . As further evidence for his proposal, Blench also cites
    ethnographic evidence such as musical instruments in Borneo shared
    in common with Austroasiatic-speaking groups in mainland Southeast
    Asia. Adelaar (1995)\[23\] has also noticed phonological and lexical
    similarities between [Land
    Dayak](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Dayak_languages "wikilink")
    and .
  - ** substratum** ("***Rongic***").\[24\] Many words of Austroasiatic
    origin have been noticed in Lepcha, suggesting a
    [汉藏语系](../Page/汉藏语系.md "wikilink") superstrate laid
    over an Austroasiatic substrate. Blench (2013) calls this branch
    "*Rongic*" based on the Lepcha autonym *Róng*.

Other languages with proposed Austroasiatic substrata are:

  - **[加茂語](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/加茂語 "wikilink")**, based on
    evidence from the register system of Jiamao, a
    [黎语支](../Page/黎语支.md "wikilink") language (Thurgood
    1992).\[25\] Jiamao is known for its highly aberrant vocabulary in
    relation to other [黎语支](../Page/黎语支.md "wikilink").
  - ****: van Reijn (1974)\[26\] notes that Kerinci, a
    [马来语群](../Page/马来语群.md "wikilink") language of central
    [蘇門答臘](../Page/蘇門答臘.md "wikilink"), shares many phonological
    similarities with Austroasiatic languages, such as  word structure
    and vowel inventory.

John Peterson (2017)\[27\] suggests that "pre-
[蒙达语族](../Page/蒙达语族.md "wikilink")" languages may have
once dominated the eastern [印度河-恒河平原](../Page/印度河-恒河平原.md "wikilink"),
and were then absorbed by Indo-Aryan languages at an early date as
Indo-Aryan spread east. Peterson notes that eastern
[印度-雅利安语支](../Page/印度-雅利安语支.md "wikilink") display
many morphosyntactic features similar to those of Munda languages, while
western Indo-Aryan languages do not.

### Sidwell (2009, 2011)

[Mekong_river_basin.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mekong_river_basin.png "fig:Mekong_river_basin.png")
--\>[湄公河](../Page/湄公河.md "wikilink") River
[流域](../Page/流域.md "wikilink").\]\]  (2009), in a  comparison of
36 languages which are well known enough to exclude loan words, finds
little evidence for internal branching, though he did find an area of
increased contact between the Bahnaric and Katuic languages, such that
languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant
[蒙达语族](../Page/蒙达语族.md "wikilink") and Nicobarese show greater
similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches,
without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic.

He therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of
Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence.
Sidwell &  (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that
there is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node, which could also
possibly be closely related to Khmuic.\[28\]

If this would the case, Sidwell & Blench suggest that Khasic may have
been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward. Sidwell &
Blench (2011) suggest  as an additional branch, and believe that a
Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating. In general, however, the
family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested
structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are
believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central
[湄公河](../Page/湄公河.md "wikilink") river valley relatively
quickly.

Subsequently, Sidwell (2015a: 179)\[29\] proposed that  subgroups with ,
just as how Khasian and Palaungic subgroup with each other. A subsequent
computational phylogenetic analysis of the Austroasiatic language family
by Sidwell (2015b)\[30\] suggests that Austroasiatic branches may have a
loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake-like structure,
with an east-west division (consisting of Munda, Khasic, Palaungic, and
Khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches)
occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present.

Integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent
archaeological findings, Paul Sidwell (2015c)\[31\] further expanded his
Mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that Austroasiatic had
ultimately expanded into [中南半島](../Page/中南半島.md "wikilink") from the
[岭南](../Page/岭南.md "wikilink") area of
[中国北方与南方](../Page/中国北方与南方.md "wikilink"),
with the subsequent Mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the
initial arrival of Neolithic farmers from southern China.

Sidwell (2015c) tentatively suggests that Austroasiatic may have begun
to split up 5,000 years B.P. during the
[新石器革命](../Page/新石器革命.md "wikilink") era of
[mainland Southeast
Asia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/mainland_Southeast_Asia "wikilink"),
with all the major branches of Austroasiatic formed by 4,000 B.P.
Austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the
western periphery of the [珠江](../Page/珠江.md "wikilink") watershed of
[岭南](../Page/岭南.md "wikilink"), which would have been either a
coastal route down the coast of Vietnam, or downstream through the
[湄公河](../Page/湄公河.md "wikilink") via
[云南省](../Page/云南省.md "wikilink").\[32\] Both the
reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic and the archaeological
record clearly show that early Austroasiatic speakers around 4,000 B.P.
cultivated rice and , kept livestock such as dogs, pigs, and chickens,
and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments.\[33\]

At 4,500 B.P., this "Neolithic package" suddenly arrived in Indochina
from the Lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier
pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer cultures, with grain husks found in
northern Indochina by 4,100 B.P. and in southern Indochina by 3,800
B.P.\[34\] However, Sidwell (2015c) found that iron is not
reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic, since each Austroasiatic branch
has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately
from Tai, Chinese, Tibetan, Malay, and other languages.

During the [铁器时代](../Page/铁器时代.md "wikilink") about 2,500 B.P.,
relatively young Austroasiatic branches in Indochina such as
[越語支](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/越語支 "wikilink"), , , and
[高棉语](../Page/高棉语.md "wikilink") were formed, while the more
internally diverse  branch (dating to about 3,000 B.P.) underwent more
extensive internal diversification.\[35\] By the Iron Age, all of the
Austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present-day locations,
with most of the diversification within Austroasiatic taking place
during the Iron Age.\[36\]

Paul Sidwell (2018)\[37\] considers the Austroasiatic language family to
have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years B.P. during the arrival of
rice agriculture in Indochina, but notes that the origin of
Proto-Austroasiatic itself is older than that date. The lexicon of
Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum. The
early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts, animal
names, natural features, and pronouns, while the names of cultural items
(agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts, which are
reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic) form part of the later stratum.

(2017)\[38\] suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence
strategies (such as boats, waterways, river fauna, and fish capture
techniques), can be reconstructed for Proto-Austroasiatic. Blench (2017)
finds widespread Austroasiatic roots for 'river, valley', 'boat',
'fish', 'catfish sp.', 'eel', 'prawn', 'shrimp' (Central Austroasiatic),
'crab', 'tortoise', 'turtle', 'otter', 'crocodile', 'heron, fishing
bird', and 'fish trap'. Archaeological evidence for the presence of
agriculture in northern [中南半島](../Page/中南半島.md "wikilink") (northern
Vietnam, Laos, and other nearby areas) dates back to only about 4,000
years B.P. (2,000 B.C.), with agriculture ultimately being introduced
from further up to the north in the Yangtze valley where it has been
dated to 6,000 B.P.\[39\]

Hence, this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of
Austroasiatic as compared to [汉藏语系](../Page/汉藏语系.md "wikilink"), whose
speakers had a distinct non-riverine culture. In addition to living an
aquatic-based lifestyle, early Austroasiatic speakers would have also
had access to livestock, crops, and newer types of watercraft. As early
Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways, they would have
encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled
in the area, such as Sino-Tibetan.\[40\]

## Writing systems

Other than Latin-based alphabets, many Austroasiatic languages are
written with the [高棉文](../Page/高棉文.md "wikilink"),
[泰文字](../Page/泰文字.md "wikilink"),
[寮文字](../Page/寮文字.md "wikilink"), and
[缅文](../Page/缅文.md "wikilink") alphabets. Vietnamese divergently
had an indigenous script based on Chinese logographic writing. This has
since been supplanted by the Latin alphabet in the 20th century. The

## External relations

### Austric languages

Austroasiatic is often included into the
[南方大語系](../Page/南方大語系.md "wikilink"), which also
includes the [南島語系](../Page/南島語系.md "wikilink") and sometimes
[日本－琉球语系](../Page/日本－琉球语系.md "wikilink").\[46\]

A 2015 analysis using the  resulted in possible support for the
Austro-Tai (but emphatically not Austric) languages. In this analysis,
the supposed "Austric" family was divided into two separate, unrelated
clades: Austro-Tai and Austroasiatic-Japonic.\[47\] Note however that
ASJP is not widely accepted among historical linguists as an adequate
method to establish or evaluate relationships between language
families.\[48\]

### Hmong-Mien

Several lexical resemblances are found between the Hmong-Mien and
Austroasiatic language families (Ratliff 2010), some of which had
earlier been proposed by
[奥德里库尔](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/奥德里库尔 "wikilink")
(1951). This could imply a relation or early language contact along the
[长江](../Page/长江.md "wikilink").\[49\]

According to Cai (et al. 2011), [苗瑶语系](../Page/苗瑶语系.md "wikilink") is at
least partially related to Austroasiatic but was heavily influenced by
[汉藏语系](../Page/汉藏语系.md "wikilink"), especially
[藏緬語族](../Page/藏緬語族.md "wikilink").\[50\]

## Austroasiatic migrations

[Mitsuru Sakitani](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:ja:崎谷満 "wikilink")
suggests that , which is common in Austroasiatic people and some other
ethnic groups in [华南地区](../Page/华南地区.md "wikilink"), and haplogroup
O1b2, which is common in today Koreans, Japanese and some Manchu, are
the carriers of Yangtze civilization (
[百越](../Page/百越.md "wikilink")).\[51\] Another study suggests
that the haplogroup O1b1 is the major Austroasiatic paternal
lineage.\[52\]

### Migration into India

According to Chaubey et al., "Austro-Asiatic speakers in India today are
derived from dispersal from
[东南亚](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/东南亚 "wikilink"),
followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local Indian
populations." According to Riccio et al., the Munda people are likely
descended from Austroasiatic migrants from southeast Asia.\[53\]\[54\]

According to Zhang et al., Austroasiatic migrations from southeast Asia
into India took place after the last Glacial maximum, circa 10,000 years
ago. Arunkumar et al. suggest Austroasiatic migrations from southeast
Asia occurred into northeast India 5.2 ± 0.6 kya and into East India
4.3 ± 0.2 kya.\[55\]

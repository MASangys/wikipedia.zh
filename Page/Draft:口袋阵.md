**口袋阵**指的是一支部队被敌军从友军或后勤系统中孤立后形成的状态。在机械化战争时代，进行类似于德国[闪电战](../Page/闪电战.md "wikilink")、突出部战术的部队更容易被包围入口袋阵，并将成为敌军毁灭打击的焦点。

值得注意的是，许多口袋阵的形成初始并不是由进行包围作战的一方主动进行，而是后来被包围的一方先在一个地区固守，其他相邻地区陷落后陷入被包围境地的情况下产生的围攻，这是与普通的小型作战以及传统正面战的显著区别。

## 执行

### 苏联军事理念

苏联军事理念将包围区分为以下几种：

  - Cauldron or kettle ( or *kotyel*): a very large, strategic-level
    concentration of trapped enemy forces
  - Sack (): an operational-level trapped enemy force
  - Nest (): a tactical-level trapped enemy force

The significance of these terms are reflected by the conception of what
can be expected in combat in encirclement operations. A cauldron is
expected to be "boiling" with combat activity, the large enemy forces
still quite able to offer "hot" resistance in the initial stages of
encirclement, and so are to be contained, but not engaged directly. A
sack in Soviet experience was often created as a result of operational
[breakthroughs](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_\(military\) "wikilink"),
and was sometimes as unexpected for the Soviet command as for the enemy.
This encirclement, sometimes of an entity of unknown size, tended to
move for some time after the initial encirclement due to inherently
dynamic nature of [operational
warfare](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/operational_warfare "wikilink").
By contrast a nest was a reference to a
[tactical](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_tactics "wikilink"),
well-defined and contained encirclement of enemy troops that was seen as
a fragile construct of enemy troops unsupported by its parent formation
(the use of the word nest is similar to the more familiar English
expression *[machine
gun](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/machine_gun "wikilink") nest*).

### Kessel

In [German](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Language "wikilink")
the word *Kessel* (literally a
[cauldron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/cauldron "wikilink")) is
commonly used to refer to an encircled military force, and a
*[Kesselschlacht](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesselschlacht "wikilink")*
(cauldron battle) refers to a [pincer
movement](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/pincer_movement "wikilink"). The
common tactic which would leave a Kessel is referred to Keil and Kessel
(Keil means *wedge*). Kessel is a
[loanword](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/loanword "wikilink") in English
texts about World War II. Another use of *Kessel* is to refer to *Kessel
fever,* the panic and hopelessness felt by any troops who were
surrounded with little or no chance of escape.

### Cerco

In [Spanish](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "wikilink")
the word *Cerco* (literally a
[fence](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/fence "wikilink") or
[siege](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege "wikilink")) is commonly
used to refer to an encircling military force. *Cercos* were
particularly common in the [Chaco
War](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaco_War "wikilink") between
[Bolivia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia "wikilink") and
[Paraguay](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay "wikilink")
(1932–1935) and encirclement battles were decisive for the outcome of
the war. In the [Campo Vía
pocket](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campo_Vía_pocket "wikilink")
7,500 Bolivians were taken prisoner out of an initial combat force of
10,000. Other *cercos* of the war include the [battle of Campo
Grande](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_Campo_Grande "wikilink")
and the [battle of Cañada
Strongest](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_Cañada_Strongest "wikilink").

### Motti

**Motti** is
[Finnish](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "wikilink")
military slang for a totally encircled enemy unit. The tactic of
encircling it is called **motitus**, literally meaning the formation of
an isolated block or "motti", but in effect meaning an *entrapment* or
*envelopment*.

The word means "mug" in many Finnish dialects; an alternate translation
refers to a cubic meter of firewood, a relatively small area in which an
encircled enemy could be "cut down" like trees. *motti* is thus related
to *[kessel](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesselschlacht "wikilink")*.
A *motti* in military tactics therefore means the formation of "bite
sized" enemy units which are easier to contain and deal with.

This [tactic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_tactic "wikilink")
of envelopment was used extensively by the Finnish forces in the [Winter
War](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War "wikilink") and the
[Continuation
War](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation_War "wikilink") to good
effect. It was especially effective against some of the [mechanized
units](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanized_military_unit "wikilink")
of the Soviet Army, which were effectively restricted to the long and
narrow forest roads with virtually no way other than forwards or
backwards. Once committed to a road, the Soviet troops effectively were
trapped. Unlike the mechanized units of the Soviets, the Finnish troops
could move quickly through the forests on skis and break columns of
armoured Soviet units into smaller chunks (e.g., by felling trees along
the road). Once the large column was split up into smaller armoured
units, the Finnish forces attacking from within the forest could strike
the weakened column. The smaller pockets of enemy troops could then be
dealt with individually by concentrating forces on all sides against the
entrapped unit.

A *motitus* is therefore a double envelopment manoeuvre, using the
ability of light troops to travel over rough ground to encircle enemy
troops on a road. Heavily outnumbered but mobile forces could easily
immobilize an enemy many times more numerous.

By cutting the enemy columns or units into smaller groups and then
encircling them with light and mobile forces, such as ski-troops during
winter, a smaller force can overwhelm a much larger force. If the
encircled enemy unit was too strong, or if attacking it would have
entailed an unacceptably high cost, e.g., because of a lack of heavy
equipment, the *motti* was usually left to "stew" until it ran out of
food, fuel, supplies, and ammunition and was weakened enough to be
eliminated. Some of the larger mottis held out until the end of the war
because they were resupplied by air. Being trapped, however, these units
were not available for battle operations.

The largest motti battles in the [Winter
War](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War "wikilink") occurred at
the [Battle of
Suomussalmi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Suomussalmi "wikilink").
Three Finnish regiments enveloped and destroyed two Soviet divisions as
well as a tank brigade trapped on a road.

吉爾伯特和埃利斯群島是位於英國的，1982年為保護區，自1916年到1976年1月1日為殖民區。此島分為兩個殖民地不久後成為獨立國家。公民投票於1974年12月舉行，確認吉伯特群島與埃利斯群島是否獨自管理。\[1\] 根據公投結果，吉爾伯特與埃利斯群島於1976年１月１後不復存在在，隨後吉里巴斯與圖瓦祿個國家建立。

## 地點

吉伯特群島 (以前稱為金斯米爾群島\[2\]) 是由十六個１６個are a chain of sixteen [atolls](../Page/環礁.md "wikilink") and coral islands in the western Pacific Ocean that are recognised as part of the [Micronesia](../Page/密克罗尼西亚群岛.md "wikilink")  of Oceania. The Gilbert Islands are the main part of what is now [Republic of Kiribati](../Page/基里巴斯.md "wikilink") ("Kiribati" is the Gilbertese rendition of "Gilberts"\[3\]) The atolls and islands of the Gilbert Islands are arranged in an approximate north-to-south line. In a geographical sense, the [equator](../Page/赤道_\(電影\).md "wikilink") serves as the dividing line between the northern Gilbert Islands and the southern Gilbert Islands. The Ellice Islands are south of the Gilbert Islands.\[4\] The [Ellice Islands](../Page/圖瓦盧.md "wikilink") comprises three [reef](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/暗礁 "wikilink") islands and six true [atolls](../Page/環礁.md "wikilink") spread out between the [latitude](../Page/纬度.md "wikilink") of  to [10° south](../Page/南緯10度線.md "wikilink") and [longitude](../Page/经度.md "wikilink") of  to [180°](../Page/180度经线.md "wikilink"), west of the [International Date Line](../Page/国际日期变更线.md "wikilink").\[5\] The Ellice Islands are midway between Hawaii and Australia. The Ellice Islands are recognised as part of the [Polynesia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/玻里尼西亞 "wikilink")  of Oceania.

## Naming

In 1606 [Pedro Fernandes de Queirós](../Page/佩德罗·费尔南德斯·德·基罗斯.md "wikilink") sighted [Butaritari](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/布塔里塔里環礁 "wikilink") and [Makin](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/馬金群島 "wikilink"), which he named the Buen Viaje (‘good trip’ in Spanish) Islands.\[6\]\[7\] The Gilbert Islands were named in 1820 by a Russian Admiral, [Baron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/俄羅斯貴族 "wikilink") [Johann von Krusenstern](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/亚当·约翰·冯·克鲁森施滕 "wikilink"), after a British captain, , who encountered the archipelago in 1788 while exploring an Outer Passage route from Port Jackson to Canton. French captain  was the first to map the whole Gilbert Islands archipelago. He commanded [*La Coquille*](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/星盤號 "wikilink") on its circumnavigation of the earth (1822–1825).\[8\]

[Funafuti](../Page/富纳富提.md "wikilink") atoll was named Ellice's Island after , a British politician and merchant, by Captain Arent de Peyster,\[9\] who sighted the islands in 1819 sailing on the ship *Rebecca*.\[10\] Ellice owned the cargo of the ship. The name Ellice was applied to all nine islands, of what is now [Tuvalu](../Page/圖瓦盧.md "wikilink"), after the work of English hydrographer .\[11\]

The Gilbert and Ellice Islands were formerly designated an [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1二位字母代码 "wikilink") country code "GE" until 1977.

## Administration of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands

### Protectorate administered as part of the British Western Pacific Territories

[右](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SS_TOKELAU_-_Government_Steamer_Gilbert_&_Ellice_Islands.jpg "fig:右") A protectorate was generally established over this area (but not over these islands) by the Pacific Islanders Protection Act\[12\] of 1857 and then in 1877 for the .

The sixteen islands of the Gilberts were declared a [British Protectorate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/保护国 "wikilink") by Captain Davis R.N., of  between 27 May and 17 June 1892.\[13\] The Ellice Islands were declared a British Protectorate by Captain Gibson R.N., of , between 9 and 16 October of the same year.\[14\]

The  (BWPT) were administered by a  resident in [Fiji](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/斐濟 "wikilink"). A , Charles Swayne, was appointed for the Ellice Islands in 1892 and for the Gilbert Islands in 1893. He was succeeded by W. Telfer Campbell in 1896, who established himself on [Tarawa Atoll](../Page/塔拉瓦环礁.md "wikilink") and remained in office until 1908. Telfer Campbell was criticised for his legislative, judicial and administrative management (including forced labour alleged to be exacted from islanders) and an inquiry was held by Arthur William Mahaffy, a former District Officer in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (1896–1898),\[15\] resulting in a report in 1909.\[16\] In 1913 an anonymous correspondent to the *New Age* journal described the maladministration of Telfer Campbell, linked it to criticisms of the  which was operating on Ocean Island, and questioned the impartiality of Mahaffy.\[17\]

The seat of government was then moved to Ocean Island (now known as [Banaba Island](../Page/巴纳巴岛.md "wikilink")), which had been included in the protectorate in 1900, to take advantage of the improved shipping connections resulting from the Pacific Phosphate Company's activities, and the status of the islands was changed on 12 January 1916\[18\] to that of a Crown Colony.\[19\] The role of the British colonial authorities emphasised the procurement of labour for the Ocean Island phosphate mining and keeping order among the workers.

### Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony

The islands became a [Crown colony](../Page/直轄殖民地.md "wikilink") on 12 January 1916 by the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Order in Council, 1915.\[20\]

[Fanning Island](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/塔布阿埃蘭環礁 "wikilink") and [Washington Island](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/泰拉伊納島 "wikilink") also became included in the colony together with the islands of the Union Islands (now known as [Tokelau](../Page/托克劳.md "wikilink")); [Christmas Island](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/圣诞岛_\(基里巴斯\) "wikilink") was included in 1919 but was contested by the U.S. under its  of 1856.\[21\] The [Union Islands](../Page/托克劳.md "wikilink") were transferred to [New Zealand](../Page/新西兰.md "wikilink") in 1926.

The Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony continued to be administered by a Resident Commissioner. In 1930 the Resident Commissioner, , issued revised laws, *Regulations for the good Order and Cleanliness of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands*, which replaced laws created during the BWTP.\[22\] The [Phoenix Islands](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/菲尼克斯群岛 "wikilink") were added to the colony in 1937.\[23\]

[Banaba Island](../Page/巴纳巴岛.md "wikilink") (Ocean Island) remained the headquarters of the colony until the British evacuation in 1942 during the [Pacific War](../Page/太平洋战争.md "wikilink") when Ocean Island and the Gilbert Islands were occupied by the Japanese. The United States forces landed in [Funafuti](../Page/富纳富提.md "wikilink") on 2 October 1942 and on [Nanumea](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/納努梅阿環礁 "wikilink") and [Nukufetau](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/努庫費陶環礁 "wikilink") in August 1943 and constructed an airfield on each island and other bases. The atolls of Tuvalu acted as a staging post during the preparation for the [Battle of Tarawa](../Page/塔拉瓦戰役.md "wikilink") and the  that commenced on 20 November 1943. Colonel Fox-Strangways, was the Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony in 1941, who was located on Funafuti.\[24\]

After World War II, the colony headquarters was re-established on [Tarawa](../Page/塔拉瓦环礁.md "wikilink"), first on [Betio](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/比休島 "wikilink") islet and subsequently on [Bairiki islet](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/拜里基島 "wikilink").\[25\]\[26\]\[27\]

By the , [sovereignty](../Page/主權.md "wikilink") over [Tokelau](../Page/托克劳.md "wikilink") was transferred to New Zealand. The five islands of the Central and Southern [Line Islands](../Page/莱恩群岛.md "wikilink") were added to the colony in 1972.\[28\]

The Tuvaluans were concerned about their minority status in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony. In 1974, ethnic differences within the colony caused the [Polynesians](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/玻里尼西亞 "wikilink") of the Ellice Islands to vote for separation from the Micronesians of the Gilbert Islands (later Kiribati). The following year, the Ellice Islands became the separate British colony of [Tuvalu](../Page/圖瓦盧.md "wikilink").

### Transition to self-determination

In 1947 [Tarawa](../Page/塔拉瓦环礁.md "wikilink"), in the Gilbert Islands, was made the administrative capital. This development included establishing The King George V Secondary School for boys and the Elaine Bernacchi Secondary School for girls.\[29\]

A Colony Conference was organised at [Marakei](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/馬拉凱環礁 "wikilink") in 1956, which was attended by officials and representatives from each island in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, conferences were held every two years until 1962. The development of administration continued with the creation in 1963 of an Advisory Council of five officials and 12 representatives who were appointed by the Resident Commissioner.\[30\]\[31\] In 1964 an Executive Council was established with eight officials and eight representatives. The representative members were elected in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Advisory Council election held in 1964. The Resident Commissioner was now required to consult the Executive Council regarding the creation of laws to making decisions that affected the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.\[32\]

A Constitution was introduced in 1967, which created a House of Representatives for the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony that comprised seven appointed officials and 23 members elected by the islanders. Tuvalu elected four members of the House of Representatives. The 1967 Constitution also established the Governing Council. The House of Representatives only had the authority to recommend laws; the Governing Council had the authority to enact laws following a recommendation from the House of Representatives.\[33\]

A select committee of the House of Representatives was established to consider whether the constitution should be changed to give legislative power to the House of Representatives. It became apparent that the Tuvaluans were concerned about their minority status on the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, and the Tuvaluans wanted equal representation to that of the I-Kiribati. A new constitution was introduced in 1971, which provided that each of the islands of Tuvalu (except [Niulakita](../Page/紐拉基塔島.md "wikilink")) elected one representative. However, that did not end the Tuvaluan movement for independence.

In 1974  was introduced in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony through a change to the Constitution.\[34\]

### Elections and the transition to parliamentary government

The 1967 constitution created a parliament, whose members were elected in the following elections:

  - Gilbert and Ellice Islands general election, 1967
  - Gilbert and Ellice Islands general election, 1970
  - Gilbert and Ellice Islands general election, 1974\[35\]

### Dissolution of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony

[缩略图](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gilbert_and_Ellice_Islands_1911_\(Mar.\)_Pandanus_Pine_1d._carmine.jpg "fig:缩略图") A referendum was held in December 1974 to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration.\[36\] As a consequence of the , separation occurred in two stages. The Tuvaluan Order 1975 made by the [Privy Council](../Page/英國樞密院.md "wikilink"), which took effect on 1 October 1975, recognised [Tuvalu](../Page/圖瓦盧.md "wikilink") as a separate British dependency with its own government. The second stage occurred on 1 January 1976 when two separate administrations were created out of the civil service of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.\[37\] The British conducted a formal inquiry into Tuvaluan attitudes towards secession, and announced that a referendum was to be held, in which Tuvaluans could choose to remain with the Gilberts or secede. They were told that if they separated they would not receive royalties from the Ocean Island phosphate or other assets of the colony. Despite this, 3799 Tuvaluans (92%) voted to secede, while 293 voted against secession. On 1 October 1975, legal separation from the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati), took place. On 1 January 1976, full administration of the new colony was transferred to Funafuti from Tarawa. Tuvalu became an independent constitutional monarchy and the 38th member of the Commonwealth on the 1 October 1978.\[38\] The Gilbert Islands attained independence on 12 July 1979 under the name [Kiribati](../Page/基里巴斯.md "wikilink") by the Kiribati Independence Order 1979, as a republic with Commonwealth membership. That day the colonial flag was lowered for the last time with a parade commemorating both the newly independent state and in memorial of the intense battles fought on [Tarawa in World War II](../Page/塔拉瓦戰役.md "wikilink"). The parade included many dignitaries from home and abroad. The name Kiribati (pronounced kʲiriˈbas) is a linguistic derivative of "Gilberts."

[Banaba Island](../Page/巴纳巴岛.md "wikilink"), formerly rich in phosphates before becoming fully depleted in the latter colonial years, also sued for independence in 1979 and boycotted the Kiribati ceremonies. The Banabans wanted greater autonomy and reparations of around $250 million for revenue they had not received and for environmental destruction caused by phosphate mining practices similar to those on [Nauru](../Page/諾魯.md "wikilink"). The British authorities had relocated most of the population to [Rabi Island](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/蘭比島 "wikilink"), [Fiji](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/斐濟 "wikilink"), after 1945, but by the 1970s many were returning to Banaba. The British rejected the Banaban independence proposal, and the island remained under the jurisdiction of Kiribati.

where the [user](../Page/用户.md "wikilink") (or
[client](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/客户端 "wikilink")) issues
[commands](../Page/命令_\(计算机\).md "wikilink") to the program in the form
of successive lines of text (command lines). A program which handles the
interface is called a **command language interpreter** or [shell
(computing)](../Page/殼層.md "wikilink").

The CLI was the primary means of interaction with most computer systems
on [computer terminals](../Page/終端.md "wikilink") in the mid-1960s, and
continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on
[OpenVMS](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS "wikilink"),
[Unix](../Page/UNIX.md "wikilink") systems and personal computer systems
including [MS-DOS](../Page/MS-DOS.md "wikilink"),
[CP/M](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M "wikilink") and . The
interface is usually implemented with a command line
[shell](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_\(computing\) "wikilink"),
which is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts
commands into appropriate operating system functions.

Today, many end users rarely, if ever, use command-line interfaces and
instead rely upon [graphical user
interfaces](../Page/图形用户界面.md "wikilink") and menu-driven
interactions. However, many software developers, system administrators
and advanced users still rely heavily on command-line interfaces to
perform tasks more efficiently, configure their machine, or access
programs and program features that are not available through a graphical
interface.

Alternatives to the command line include, but are not limited to
[menus](../Page/選單.md "wikilink") (see  for example), [keyboard
shortcuts](../Page/快捷键.md "wikilink"), and various other [desktop
metaphors](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/桌面比擬 "wikilink") centered on
the [pointer](../Page/光标_\(图形用户界面\).md "wikilink") (usually controlled
with a [mouse](../Page/鼠标.md "wikilink")). Examples of this include the
Windows versions 1, 2, 3, 3.1, and 3.11 (an OS shell that runs in DOS),
, and Mouse Systems PowerPanel.

Programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate
via [scripting](../Page/脚本语言.md "wikilink").

Command-line interfaces for software other than operating systems
include a number of programming languages such as
[Tcl/Tk](../Page/Tcl.md "wikilink"), [PHP](../Page/PHP.md "wikilink"),
and others, as well as [utilities](../Page/实用程序.md "wikilink") such as
the [compression](../Page/数据压缩.md "wikilink") utility
[WinZip](../Page/WinZip.md "wikilink"), and some
[FTP](../Page/文件传输协议.md "wikilink") and
[SSH](../Page/Secure_Shell.md "wikilink")/[Telnet](../Page/Telnet.md "wikilink")
clients.

## Comparison to graphical user interfaces

Compared with a graphical user interface, a command line requires fewer
system resources to implement. Since options to commands are given in a
few characters in each command line, an experienced user finds the
options easier to access. Automation of repetitive tasks is simplified -
most operating systems using a command line interface support some
mechanism for storing frequently used sequences in a disk file, for
re-use; this may extend to a [scripting
language](../Page/脚本语言.md "wikilink") that can take parameters
and variable options. A command-line history can be kept, allowing
review or repetition of commands.

A command-line system may require paper or online manuals for the user's
reference, although often a "help" option provides a concise review of
the options of a command. The command-line environment may not provide
the graphical enhancements such as different fonts or extended edit
windows found in a GUI. It may be difficult for a new user to become
familiar with all the commands and options available, compared with the
drop-down menus of a graphical user interface, without repeated
reference to manuals.

## Operating system command-line interfaces

Operating system (OS) command line interfaces are usually distinct
programs supplied with the operating system. A program that implements
such a text interface is often called a command-line interpreter,
command processor or [shell](../Page/殼層.md "wikilink").

Examples of command-line interpreters include
[DEC's](../Page/迪吉多.md "wikilink")  (DCL) in
[OpenVMS](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS "wikilink") and
[RSX-11](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSX-11 "wikilink"), the various
[Unix shells](../Page/Unix_shell.md "wikilink")
([sh](../Page/Bourne_shell.md "wikilink"),
[ksh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_shell "wikilink"),
[csh](../Page/C_Shell.md "wikilink"),
[tcsh](../Page/Tcsh.md "wikilink"), [bash](../Page/Bash.md "wikilink"),
etc.), [CP/M](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M "wikilink")'s
[CCP](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M "wikilink"),
[DOS](../Page/DOS.md "wikilink")'s
[COMMAND.COM](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMMAND.COM "wikilink"), as
well as the [OS/2](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2 "wikilink") and
the Windows [CMD.EXE](../Page/命令提示字元.md "wikilink") programs, the latter
groups being based heavily on DEC's RSX-11 and  CLIs. Under most
operating systems, it is possible to replace the default shell program
with alternatives; examples include  for DOS,  for OS/2, and  or  for
Windows.

Although the term 'shell' is often used to describe a command-line
interpreter, strictly speaking a 'shell' can be any program that
constitutes the user-interface, including fully graphically oriented
ones. For example, the default Windows GUI is a shell program named
EXPLORER.EXE, as defined in the SHELL=EXPLORER.EXE line in the WIN.INI
configuration file. These programs are shells, but not CLIs.

## Application command-line interfaces

Application programs (as opposed to operating systems) may also have
command line interfaces.

An application program may support none, any, or all of these three
major types of command line interface mechanisms:

1.  **Parameters**: Most operating systems support a means to pass
    additional information to a program when it is launched. When a
    program is launched from an OS command line shell, additional text
    provided along with the program name is passed to the launched
    program.
2.  **Interactive command line sessions**: After launch, a program may
    provide an operator with an independent means to enter commands in
    the form of text.
3.  **OS inter-process communication**: Most operating systems support
    means of [inter-process communication](../Page/行程間通訊.md "wikilink")
    (for example; [standard streams](../Page/標準串流.md "wikilink") or
    [named pipes](../Page/命名管道.md "wikilink")). Command lines from
    client processes may be redirected to a CLI program by one of these
    methods.

Some applications support only a CLI, presenting a CLI prompt to the
user and acting upon command lines as they are entered. Other programs
support both a CLI and a GUI. In some cases, a GUI is simply a
[wrapper](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/包裝函式 "wikilink") around a
separate CLI [executable file](../Page/執行檔.md "wikilink"). In other
cases, a program may provide a CLI as an optional alternative to its
GUI. CLIs and GUIs often support different functionality. For example,
all features of [MATLAB](../Page/MATLAB.md "wikilink"), a [numerical
analysis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/数值分析 "wikilink") computer
program, are available via the CLI, whereas the MATLAB GUI exposes only
a subset of features.

The early Sierra games, like the first three [King's
Quest](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/國王密使系列 "wikilink") games
(1984–1986), used commands from an internal command line to move the
character around in the graphic window.

## History

The command-line interface evolved from a form of dialog once conducted
by humans over [teleprinter](../Page/電傳打字機.md "wikilink") (TTY)
machines, in which human operators remotely exchanged information,
usually one line of text at a time. Early computer systems often used
teleprinter machines as the means of interaction with a human operator.
The computer became one end of the human-to-human teleprinter model. So
instead of a human communicating with another human over a teleprinter,
a human communicated with a computer.

The mechanical teleprinter was replaced by a ["glass
tty"](../Page/終端.md "wikilink"), a keyboard and screen emulating the
teleprinter. ["Smart"
terminals](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal "wikilink")
permitted additional functions, such as cursor movement over the entire
screen, or local editing of data on the terminal for transmission to the
computer. As the  replaced the traditionalminicomputer + terminals[time
sharing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/分時系統 "wikilink") architecture,
hardware terminals were replaced by [terminal
emulators](../Page/虚拟终端.md "wikilink") — PC software that
interpreted terminal signals sent through the PC's [serial
ports](../Page/串行端口.md "wikilink"). These were typically used to
interface an organization's new PC's with their existing mini- or
mainframe computers, or to connect PC to PC. Some of these PCs were
running [Bulletin Board System](../Page/BBS.md "wikilink") software.

Early operating system CLIs were implemented as part of  programs, and
could not easily be replaced. The first implementation of the shell as a
replaceable component was part of the
[Multics](../Page/Multics.md "wikilink")
[time-sharing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/time-sharing "wikilink")
[operating system](../Page/操作系统.md "wikilink").\[2\] In 1964,  staff
member [Louis Pouzin](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/路易斯·普贊 "wikilink")
developed the
[RUNCOM](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rc文件_\(UNIX\) "wikilink")
tool for executing command scripts while allowing argument
substitution.\[3\] Pouzin coined the term "
[shell](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_\(computing\) "wikilink")"
to describe the technique of using commands like a programming language,
and wrote a paper about how to implement the idea in the
[Multics](../Page/Multics.md "wikilink") operating system.\[4\] Pouzin
returned to his native France in 1965, and the first Multics shell was
developed by [Glenda
Schroeder](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/格倫達·施羅德 "wikilink").\[5\]

The first [Unix shell](../Page/Unix_shell.md "wikilink"), the [V6
shell](../Page/Thompson_shell.md "wikilink"), was developed by [Ken
Thompson](../Page/肯·汤普逊.md "wikilink") in 1971 at [Bell
Labs](../Page/贝尔实验室.md "wikilink") and was modeled after
Schroeder's Multics shell.\[6\]\[7\] The [Bourne
shell](../Page/Bourne_shell.md "wikilink") was introduced in 1977 as a
replacement for the V6 shell. Although it is used as an interactive
command interpreter, it was also intended as a scripting language and
contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce
structured programs. The Bourne shell led to the development of the
[Korn shell](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_shell "wikilink") (ksh),
[Almquist shell](../Page/Almquist_shell.md "wikilink") (ash), and the
popular [Bourne-again shell](../Page/Bash.md "wikilink") (or Bash).\[8\]

Early microcomputers themselves were based on a command-line interface
such as [CP/M](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M "wikilink"),
[DOS](../Page/DOS.md "wikilink") or [AppleSoft
BASIC](../Page/Applesoft_BASIC.md "wikilink"). During the 1980s and
1990s, the introduction of the [Apple
Macintosh](../Page/麥金塔.md "wikilink") and of [Microsoft
Windows](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "wikilink") on
PCs saw the command line interface as the primary user interface
replaced by the [Graphical User
Interface](../Page/图形用户界面.md "wikilink"). The command line
remained available as an alternative user interface, often used by
[system administrators](../Page/系统管理员.md "wikilink") and other advanced
users for system administration, [computer
programming](../Page/程序设计.md "wikilink") and [batch
processing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/批处理任务 "wikilink").

In November 2006, [Microsoft](../Page/微软.md "wikilink") released version
1.0 of [Windows PowerShell](../Page/Windows_PowerShell.md "wikilink")
(formerly codenamed *Monad*), which combined features of traditional
Unix shells with their proprietary object-oriented [.NET
Framework](../Page/.NET框架.md "wikilink").
[MinGW](../Page/MinGW.md "wikilink") and
[Cygwin](../Page/Cygwin.md "wikilink") are
[open-source](../Page/开放源代码.md "wikilink") packages for
Windows that offer a Unix-like CLI. Microsoft provides 's
[ksh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_shell "wikilink")
implementation *MKS Korn shell* for Windows through their  add-on.

Since 2001, the
[Macintosh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh "wikilink")
operating system is based on a variation of Unix called
[Darwin](../Page/Darwin_\(操作系统\).md "wikilink"). On these computers,
users can access a Unix-like command-line interface called
[Terminal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/终端_\(macOS\) "wikilink") found
in the Applications Utilities folder. This terminal uses
[bash](../Page/Bash.md "wikilink") by default.

## Usage

A CLI is used whenever a large vocabulary of commands or queries,
coupled with a wide (or arbitrary) range of options, can be entered more
rapidly as text than with a pure GUI. This is typically the case with
&\] \[…\] /?, /Help Display this help screen or specific help for a
topic (+) \[…\] /\!, /About Display the 'About' info screen \[…\]
/Cpifile (+) .CPI/.CP file name \<EGA.CPI\>; extension: \<.CPI\>;

**夏令時間**（，英國與其他地區），又稱**日光節約時間**（，美國），是一種在夏季月份犧牲正常的日出時間，而將時間調快的做法。通常，使用夏令時間的地區，會在接近春季開始的時候。將時間調快一小時，並在秋季調回正常時間\[1\]。實際上，夏令時間會造成在春季以後的睡眠時間減少一小時，而在秋季以後則會多出一小時的睡眠時間\[2\]\[3\]。

1895年，提出了夏令時間的概念\[4\]。1916年4月30日，[德意志帝國](../Page/德意志帝國.md "wikilink")與[奧匈帝國首次在全國實施夏令時間](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/奧匈帝國 "wikilink")。後來在不同時期都曾實行夏令時間，其中以來尤為盛行。鄰近赤道的地區通常不實施夏令時間，因為這些地區的日出變化無法成為實施夏令時間的正當理由。部分國家只在其中部分地區實施夏令時間；例如，夏令時間於巴西南部實施，但在巴西赤道地區則不實施\[5\]。由於亞洲與非洲地區一般不實施夏令時間，因此全球只有少數人口才會採用此制度。

有時，夏令時間的轉換會讓守時習慣變得更加複雜，並且會擾亂旅行、計費、紀錄保存、醫療設備、重機設備\[6\]與睡眠模式的運作\[7\]。電腦軟體通常可以自動轉換時間，但各地不同司法管轄區的夏令時間與日期政策可能會有所更動，因而可能會令人困惑\[8\]。

## 緣由

通常會遵循以時間為基礎的日常活動行程；而這些行程在一年當中不會發生變化。例如，每個人工作或就學的開始與結束時間，以及[公共交通](../Page/公共交通.md "wikilink")的調度運作，通常一整年會維持不變。相較之下，[農業社會](../Page/農業社會.md "wikilink")的日常作息容易受到白晝時長\[9\]\[10\][太陽日的影響](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/太陽日 "wikilink")；其中太陽日會因為[地軸傾斜而產生](../Page/轉軸傾角.md "wikilink")[季節性的變化](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/季節 "wikilink")。熱帶地區以北與以南地帶的夏季白晝時間比冬季長；越遠離熱帶地區，這種差異愈會更加明顯。

如果將某個地區的所有時間進行重設，從而比[標準時間](../Page/標準時間.md "wikilink")提早一小時，這樣遵循年度行程的人們將會比正常情況提早一個小時醒來；他們將會早一個小時完成日常工作行程，並且在工作活動之後提供額外的一個小時\[11\]\[12\]。然而，他們在每天開始就會少掉一個小時的日光，如此在冬季實施這項政策會變得不實際\[13\]\[14\]。

雖然日出與日落時間的變化，會隨著季節的變化具有大致相同的變化，然而夏令時間的支持者認為，大多數人們在一般的「[朝九晚五](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/工時規管 "wikilink")」工作日，比較喜歡延長白晝時間\[15\]\[16\]。支持者也認為夏令時間可以減少照明與暖氣的供應，進而降低，但這項政策在整體能源利用的實際影響方面，有著非常大的爭議。

高緯度地區（如[冰島](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/冰島 "wikilink")、[努納福特](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/努納福特 "wikilink")、[斯堪地那維亞與](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/斯堪地那維亞 "wikilink")[阿拉斯加](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/阿拉斯加 "wikilink")）的時間操縱對於日常生活而言幾乎沒有影響，因為比起其他緯度地區相比，這些地區的日夜時長變化更為極端，因此無論時間如何操縱，日出與日落時間都會明顯異於標準的工作時數\[17\]。夏令時間對於鄰近赤道地區而言，也沒有太大用處，因為這些地區的白晝時長，在一整年當中的變動幅度非常微小\[18\]。夏令時間的影響也會因為同[時區內東西地點的距離而有所變化](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/時區 "wikilink")；在同一時區中，最東部的地區會比最西部的地區，更容易獲得夏令時間的益處\[19\]。

## 歷史

[Clepsydra-Diagram-Fancy.jpeg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clepsydra-Diagram-Fancy.jpeg "fig:Clepsydra-Diagram-Fancy.jpeg")會隨著季節變化，改變小時的長度。\]\] 古代文明會依據太陽調整日常作息，比起夏令時間而言更加靈活；無論白晝時長如何，他們會將白天切割成12小時，因此每個小時的長度在春夏會逐漸拉長，到了秋冬則會逐漸縮短\[20\]。例如，採用[水鐘](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/水鐘 "wikilink")，上面會依據一年中的不同月份，有著不同的尺規；依據羅馬地區的緯度，[冬季](../Page/冬至.md "wikilink")[至點](../Page/至點.md "wikilink")的日出後第三小時（[三時經](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/三時經 "wikilink")）為[太陽時](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/太陽時 "wikilink")9時2分並持續44分鐘，但在[夏至](../Page/夏至.md "wikilink")則為6時58分並持續75分鐘\[21\]。From the 14th century onwards, equal-length civil hours supplanted unequal ones, so [civil time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_time "wikilink") no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of [Mount Athos](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Athos "wikilink")\[22\] and all Jewish ceremonies.\[23\]

[Benjamin Franklin](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "wikilink") published the proverb "early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise",\[24\]\[25\] and he published a letter in the *[Journal de Paris](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_de_Paris "wikilink")* during his time as an American envoy to France (1776–1785) suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight.\[26\] This 1784 satire proposed taxing window shutters, rationing candles, and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise.\[27\] Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not even keep precise schedules. However, this changed as rail transport and communication networks required a standardization of time unknown in Franklin's day.\[28\]

In 1810, the Spanish National Assembly [Cortes of Cádiz](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortes_of_Cádiz "wikilink") issued a regulation that moved certain meeting times forward by one hour from May 1 to September 30 in recognition of seasonal changes, but it did not actually change the clocks. It also acknowledged that private businesses were in the practice of changing their opening hours to suit daylight conditions, but they did so of their own volition.\[29\]\[30\]

[George-Vernon-Hudson-RSNZ.jpeg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:George-Vernon-Hudson-RSNZ.jpeg "fig:George-Vernon-Hudson-RSNZ.jpeg") invented modern DST, proposing it first in 1895.\]\]

New Zealand entomologist [George Hudson](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hudson_\(entomologist\) "wikilink") first proposed modern DST. His shift-work job gave him leisure time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight.\[31\] In 1895, he presented a paper to the [Wellington Philosophical Society](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_of_New_Zealand#Regional_Constituent_Organisations "wikilink") proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift,\[32\] and considerable interest was expressed in [Christchurch](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch "wikilink"); he followed up with an 1898 paper.\[33\] Many publications credit the DST proposal to prominent English builder and outdoorsman [William Willett](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Willett "wikilink"),\[34\] who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride when he observed how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer day.\[35\] Willett also was an avid golfer who disliked cutting short his round at dusk.\[36\] His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months, and he published the proposal two years later.\[37\] Liberal Party member of parliament [Robert Pearce](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Pearce_\(British_politician\) "wikilink") took up the proposal, introducing the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on February 12, 1908.\[38\] A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.

[Port Arthur, Ontario](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur,_Ontario "wikilink") was the first city in the world to enact DST on July 1, 1908.\[39\]\[40\] This was followed by [Orillia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orillia "wikilink"), Ontario, introduced by William Sword Frost while mayor from 1911 to 1912.\[41\] The first states to adopt DST () nationally were those of the [German Empire](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "wikilink") and its [World War I](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "wikilink") ally [Austria-Hungary](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "wikilink") commencing April 30, 1916 as a way to conserve coal during wartime. Britain, most of its [allies](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I "wikilink"), and many European neutrals soon followed. Russia and a few other countries waited until the next year, and the United States adopted daylight saving in 1918. Most jurisdictions abandoned daylight saving time in the years after the war ended in 1918, with exceptions including Canada, the UK, France, Ireland, and the United States. However, many places adopted it for periods of time during the following decades, and it became common during [World War II](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "wikilink"). It became widely adopted in America and Europe starting in the 1970s as a result of the [1970s energy crisis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_energy_crisis "wikilink"). Since then, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals.\[42\] For specific details, see [Daylight saving time by country](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_by_country "wikilink").

## 程序

一般夏令時間會在週末的午夜時分以後，隨即進行調快時間的作業，以減低每週工作行程中斷的可能風選\[43\]。通常夏令時間的慣例是調快1小時，但過去曾經也有採用調快20分鐘以及2小時的情形。所有使用夏令時間的國家會在春季將時鐘調快，並在秋季調整回來；在春季調快時鐘會減少當日的時長，而在秋季調慢時鐘會增加當日的時長。舉例，如果在春天的午夜時分調快1小時，以數字顯示的本地時間將會從11:59:59.9跳至01:00:00.0。

The time at which clocks are to be shifted differs across jurisdictions. The [European Union](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "wikilink") has a coordinated shift, shifting all zones at the same instant, at 01:00 [Coordinated Universal Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "wikilink") (UTC), which means that it changes at 02:00 [Central European Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time "wikilink") (CET) or 03:00 [Eastern European Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_European_Time "wikilink") (EET), the result is that the time differences across European time zone remain constant.\[44\]\[45\] North America shifts at 02:00 but at the local time and is consequently uncoordinated so that, for example, [Mountain Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone "wikilink") is, for one hour, zero hours ahead of Pacific Time instead of one hour ahead in the autumn and two hours instead of one ahead of [Pacific Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone "wikilink") in the spring.

The dates on which clocks are to be shifted also vary with location and year; consequently, the time differences between regions also vary throughout the year. For example, Central European Time is usually six hours ahead [North American Eastern Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone "wikilink"), except for a few weeks in March and October/November, while the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could be five hours apart during the northern summer, three hours during the southern summer, and four hours a few weeks per year. Since 1996, [European Summer Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Summer_Time "wikilink") has been observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union.\[46\] Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year.\[47\] Moreover, the beginning and ending dates are roughly reversed between the northern and southern hemispheres because spring and autumn are displaced six months. For example, mainland [Chile](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Chile "wikilink") observes DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March, with transitions at [24:00](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Midnight_00:00_and_24:00 "wikilink") local time.\[48\] In some countries time is governed by regional jurisdictions within the country so that some jurisdictions shift and others do not; this is currently the case in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the United States.\[49\]\[50\]

From year to year, the shift dates may change for political and social reasons. The 2007 U.S. change was part of the [Energy Policy Act of 2005](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005 "wikilink"); previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and [Congress](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "wikilink") retains the right to go back to the previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done.\[51\] Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to [Halloween](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween "wikilink") as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31. In the past, [Australian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Central_Daylight_Time "wikilink") state jurisdictions not only changed at different local times but sometimes on different dates; for example, in 2008 most DST-observing states shifted clocks forward on October 5 but [Western Australia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia "wikilink") shifted on October 26.\[52\]

## Politics

Daylight saving has caused controversy since it began.<ref name="Downing-Prerau">DST practices and controversies:

  -
  - The British version, focusing on the UK, is </ref> [Winston Churchill](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "wikilink") argued that it enlarges "the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people who live in this country"\[53\] and pundits have dubbed it "Daylight Slaving Time".\[54\] Retailing, sports, and tourism interests have historically favored daylight saving, while agricultural and evening entertainment interests have opposed it; its initial adoption was prompted by energy crises and war.\[55\]

The fate of Willett's 1907 proposal illustrates several political issues. It attracted many supporters, including [Arthur Balfour](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Balfour "wikilink"), Churchill, [David Lloyd George](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_George "wikilink"), [Ramsay MacDonald](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald "wikilink"), [Edward VII](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII "wikilink") (who used half-hour DST at Sandringham or "[Sandringham time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandringham_time "wikilink")"), the managing director of [Harrods](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrods "wikilink"), and the manager of the National Bank. However, the opposition was stronger, including Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith "wikilink"), [William Christie](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Christie_\(astronomer\) "wikilink") (the [Astronomer Royal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer_Royal "wikilink")), [George Darwin](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Darwin "wikilink"), [Napier Shaw](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napier_Shaw "wikilink") (director of the Meteorological Office), many agricultural organizations, and theatre owners. After many hearings, the proposal was narrowly defeated in a parliamentary committee vote in 1909. Willett's allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914, to no avail.\[56\] The U.S. was even more skeptical; [Andrew Peters](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_James_Peters "wikilink") introduced a DST bill to the House of Representatives in May 1909, but it soon died in committee.\[57\]

[Victory-Cigar-Congress-Passes-DST.jpeg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Victory-Cigar-Congress-Passes-DST.jpeg "fig:Victory-Cigar-Congress-Passes-DST.jpeg") hailed a 1918 DST bill\]\]

Germany led the way by starting DST () during [World War I](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "wikilink") on April 30, 1916 together with [its allies](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers "wikilink") to alleviate hardships from wartime coal shortages and air raid blackouts. The political equation changed in other countries; the United Kingdom used DST first on May 21, 1916.\[58\] U.S. retailing and manufacturing interests led by [Pittsburgh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh "wikilink") industrialist Robert Garland soon began lobbying for DST, but they were opposed by railroads. The U.S.'s 1917 entry to the war overcame objections, and DST was established in 1918.\[59\]

The war's end swung the pendulum back. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it after the war. Britain was an exception; it retained DST nationwide but adjusted transition dates over the years for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. Now summer time begins annually on the last Sunday in March under a European Community directive, which may be Easter Sunday (as in 2016).\[60\] The U.S. was more typical; Congress repealed DST after 1919. President [Woodrow Wilson](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "wikilink") was also an avid golfer like Willet, and he vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden.\[61\] Only a few U.S. cities retained DST locally,\[62\] including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and [Cleveland](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland "wikilink") to keep pace with New York.\[63\] Wilson's successor [Warren G. Harding](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_G._Harding "wikilink") opposed DST as a "deception", reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer. He ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 8 a.m. rather than 9 a.m. during the summer of 1922. Some businesses followed suit, though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.\[64\]

Since Germany's adoption in 1916, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals of DST, with similar politics involved.\[65\] The [history of time in the United States](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_time_in_the_United_States "wikilink") includes DST during both world wars, but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966.\[66\]\[67\] [St. Paul](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul,_Minnesota "wikilink") and [Minneapolis, Minnesota](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis,_Minnesota "wikilink"), were on different times for two weeks in May 1965 when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting Daylight Saving Time, while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law.\[68\] In the mid-1980s, [Clorox](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clorox "wikilink") and [7-Eleven](../Page/7-Eleven.md "wikilink") provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to U.S. DST, and both senators from [Idaho](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho "wikilink") voted for it based on the premise that fast-food restaurants sell more French fries during DST, which are made from Idaho potatoes.\[69\]

A [referendum on daylight saving](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_daylight_saving_referendum,_1992 "wikilink") was held in [Queensland, Australia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland,_Australia "wikilink"), in 1992, after a three-year trial of daylight saving. It was defeated with a 54.5% "no" vote, with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, while those in the metropolitan southeast were in favor.\[70\] In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the [National Association of Convenience Stores](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Convenience_Stores "wikilink") successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to U.S. DST.\[71\] In December 2008, the [Daylight Saving for South East Queensland](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_Saving_for_South_East_Queensland "wikilink") (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating the implementation of a dual-time zone arrangement for daylight saving in [South East Queensland](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_Queensland "wikilink"), while the rest of the state maintains standard time.\[72\] DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested.\[73\] After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed.\[74\] Queensland Independent member [Peter Wellington](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wellington "wikilink") introduced the [Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_Saving_for_South_East_Queensland_Referendum_Act_2010 "wikilink") into the Queensland parliament on April 14, 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, calling for a referendum at the next state election on the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement.\[75\] The Bill was defeated in the Queensland parliament on June 15, 2011.\[76\]

In the UK, the [Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Accidents "wikilink") supports a proposal to observe SDST's additional hour year-round, but that is opposed in some industries, such as postal workers and farmers, and particularly by those living in the northern regions of the UK.\[77\] In some Muslim countries, DST is temporarily abandoned during [Ramadan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan "wikilink") (the month when no food should be eaten between sunrise and sunset), since the DST would delay the evening dinner. Iran maintains DST during Ramadan,\[78\] but most Muslim countries do not use DST, partially for this reason.

Russia declared in 2011 that it would stay in DST all year long, followed by a similar declaration from [Belarus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus "wikilink").\[79\] Russia's plan generated widespread complaints due to the dark of winter time morning, and thus was abandoned in 2014.\[80\] The country changed its clocks to Standard Time on October 26, 2014 and intends to stay there permanently.\[81\]

## Dispute over benefits and drawbacks

[William-Willett.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:William-Willett.jpg "fig:William-Willett.jpg") independently proposed DST in 1907 and advocated it tirelessly.\[82\]\]\] Proponents of DST generally argue that it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health, reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime or is good for business.

Opponents argue that actual energy savings are inconclusive,\[83\] that DST increases health risks such as heart attack,\[84\] that DST can disrupt morning activities, and that the act of changing clocks twice a year is economically and socially disruptive and cancels out any benefit. Farmers have tended to oppose DST.\[85\]\[86\]

Having a common agreement about the day's layout or schedule has so many advantages that a standard schedule over whole countries or large areas has generally been chosen over efforts in which some people get up earlier and others do not.\[87\] The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight.\[88\] DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because the days are shorter then; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and students may need to leave for school in the dark.\[89\] Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate. Because of this variation, it is hard to make generalized conclusions about the effects of the practice. The costs and benefits may differ between places. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with other areas rather than for any other benefits.

### Energy use

[Subtropical.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Subtropical.png "fig:Subtropical.png") A 2017 meta-analysis of 44 studies found that DST leads to electricity savings of only 0.34% during the days when DST applies.\[90\]\[91\] The meta-analysis furthermore found that "electricity savings are larger for countries farther away from the equator, while subtropical regions consume more electricity because of DST."\[92\]\[93\] This means that DST may conserve electricity in some countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, but be wasteful in other places, such as Mexico, the southern United States, and northern Africa. The savings in electricity may also be offset by extra use of other types of energy, such as heating fuel.

The period of Daylight Saving Time before the longest day is shorter than the period after, in several countries including the United States and Europe. For example, in the U.S. the period of Daylight Saving Time is defined by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for Daylight Saving Time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.

DST's potential to save energy comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada.\[94\] (For comparison, air conditioning uses 16.5% of energy in the United States.\[95\]) Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of [incandescent lighting](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/incandescent_lighting "wikilink"), once a primary use of electricity.\[96\] Although energy conservation remains an important goal,\[97\] energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, so the results of a study conducted in one place may not be relevant to another country or climate.\[98\]

  - In the United States, high-quality research indicates that DST reduces residential lighting costs but usually increases total energy consumption, especially when non-electricity sources of energy consumption are considered.\[99\]\[100\] These non-electricity sources of energy consumption include extra heating fuel on the colder, darker mornings and extra gasoline used to drive to shopping and sporting activities. In some cases, DST increases residential electricity consumption, such as when people use more [air conditioning](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_conditioning "wikilink") in the longer, hotter evenings.\[101\]
  - A 2007 study estimated that winter daylight saving would prevent a 2% increase in average daily electricity consumption in Great Britain.\[102\] This paper was revised in October 2009.\[103\]
  - In 2000, when parts of [Australia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia "wikilink") began DST in late winter, overall electricity consumption did not change, but the morning peak load and prices increased.\[104\] The overall consumption was the same because people used more electricity in the dark mornings, and correspondingly less electricity in the brighter evenings. In [Western Australia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia "wikilink") during summer 2006–2007, DST increased electricity consumption during hotter days and decreased it during cooler days, with consumption rising 0.6% overall.\[105\]
  - Although a 2007 study estimated that introducing DST to Japan would reduce household lighting energy consumption,\[106\] a 2007 simulation estimated that DST would increase overall energy use in [Osaka](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka "wikilink") residences by 0.13%, with a 0.02% decrease due to less lighting more than outweighed by a 0.15% increase due to extra cooling; neither study examined non-residential energy use.\[107\] This is probably because DST's effect on lighting energy use is mainly noticeable in residences.\[108\]

Several studies have suggested that DST increases motor fuel consumption.\[109\] The 2008 DOE report found no significant increase in motor gasoline consumption due to the 2007 United States extension of DST.\[110\]

### Economic effects

Those who benefit most from DST are the retailers, sporting goods makers, and other businesses that benefit from extra afternoon sunlight.\[111\] Having more hours of sunlight in between the end of the typical workday and bedtime induces customers to shop and to participate in outdoor afternoon sports.\[112\] People are more likely to stop by a store on their way home from work if the sun is still up.\[113\] In 1984, *[Fortune](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_\(magazine\) "wikilink")* magazine estimated that a seven-week extension of DST would yield an additional $30 million for [7-Eleven](../Page/7-Eleven.md "wikilink") stores, and the [National Golf Foundation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Golf_Foundation "wikilink") estimated the extension would increase golf industry revenues $200 million to $300 million.\[114\] A 1999 study estimated that DST increases the revenue of the [European Union](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "wikilink")'s leisure sector by about 3%.\[115\]

Conversely, DST can harm some farmers,\[116\]\[117\] young children, who have difficulty getting enough sleep at night when the evenings are bright,\[118\] and others whose hours are set by the sun.<ref name="farming">Effect on those whose hours are set by the sun:

  -
  - </ref> One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer, their labor is less valuable.\[119\] Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows are sensitive to the timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems.\[120\]\[121\] Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.\[122\]

DST also hurts prime-time television broadcast ratings,\[123\]\[124\] [drive-ins](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-in_theater "wikilink") and other theaters.\[125\]

Changing clocks and DST rules has a direct economic cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500 million to $1 billion,\[126\] and [Utah State University](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_State_University "wikilink") economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around US$1.7 billion.\[127\] Although it has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased [economic efficiency](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_efficiency "wikilink"), and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31 billion on U.S. stock exchanges,\[128\] the estimated numbers depend on the methodology.\[129\] The results have been disputed,\[130\] and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.\[131\]

### Public safety

In 1975 the [United States Department of Transportation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation "wikilink") (DOT) conservatively identified a 0.7% reduction in traffic fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%,\[132\] but the 1976 NBS review of the DOT study found no differences in traffic fatalities.\[133\] In 1995 the [Insurance Institute for Highway Safety](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_Institute_for_Highway_Safety "wikilink") estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians.\[134\] Others have found similar reductions.\[135\] Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST.\[136\] However, accidents do increase by as much as 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time.\[137\] It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts.\[138\] A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. Four reports have found that this effect is smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities.\[139\]\[140\]\[141\]\[142\] A 2009 U.S. study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and more severely.\[143\]

DST likely reduces some kinds of crime, such as robbery and sexual assault, as fewer potential victims are outdoors after dusk.\[144\]\[145\] Artificial outdoor lighting has a marginal and sometimes even contradictory influence on crime and fear of crime.\[146\]

In several countries, fire safety officials encourage citizens to use the two annual clock shifts as reminders to replace batteries in [smoke](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_detector "wikilink") and [carbon monoxide detectors](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbon_monoxide_detector "wikilink"), particularly in autumn, just before the heating and candle season causes an increase in home fires. Similar twice-yearly tasks include reviewing and practicing fire escape and family disaster plans, inspecting vehicle lights, checking storage areas for hazardous materials, reprogramming thermostats, and seasonal vaccinations.<ref>Clock shifts as safety reminders:

  -
  -
  - </ref> Locations without DST can instead use the first days of spring and autumn as reminders.\[147\]

A 2017 study in the *[American Economic Journal: Applied Economics](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Economic_Journal "wikilink")* estimated that "the transition into DST caused over 30 deaths at a social cost of $275 million annually," primarily by increasing sleep deprivation.\[148\]

### Health

There is a bulge in the centre during summer, when sunrise is early and sunset late. There are step functions in spring and fall, when DST starts and stops.| Clock shifts affecting apparent sunrise and sunset times at [Greenwich](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich "wikilink") in 2007\[149\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Greenwich_GB_DaylightChart.png "wikilink") [SpringFwd-FallBack.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SpringFwd-FallBack.png "fig:SpringFwd-FallBack.png")

DST has mixed effects on health. In societies with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise.\[150\] It alters sunlight exposure; whether this is beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers [vitamin D](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitamin_D "wikilink") synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer.\[151\] DST may help in [depression](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/depression_\(mood\) "wikilink") by causing individuals to rise earlier,\[152\] but some argue the reverse.\[153\] The [Retinitis Pigmentosa](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_Pigmentosa "wikilink") Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate [Gordon Gund](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Gund "wikilink"), successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for U.S. DST extensions.\[154\]\[155\] DST shifts are associated with higher rates of [ischemic stroke](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ischemic_stroke "wikilink") in the first two days after the shift, though not in the week thereafter.\[156\]

Clock shifts were found to increase the risk of heart attack by 10 percent,\[157\] and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency.\[158\] Effects on seasonal adaptation of the [circadian rhythm](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/circadian_rhythm "wikilink") can be severe and last for weeks.<ref>DST and circadian rhythm:

  -
  -
</ref> A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise in the weeks after the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season.\[159\] A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition.\[160\] A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward.\[161\] In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.\[162\]

The government of [Kazakhstan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan "wikilink") cited health complications due to clock shifts as a reason for abolishing DST in 2005.\[163\] In March 2011, [Dmitri Medvedev](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Medvedev "wikilink"), president of Russia, claimed that "stress of changing clocks" was the motivation for Russia to stay in DST all year long. Officials at the time talked about an annual increase in suicides.\[164\]

An unexpected adverse effect of daylight saving time may lie in the fact that an extra part of morning rush hour traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than during daylight hours.\[165\]

In 2017, researchers at the [University of Washington](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington "wikilink") and the [University of Virginia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia "wikilink") reported that judges who experienced sleep deprivation as a result of DST tended to issue longer sentences.\[166\]

### Complexity and disadvantages

DST's clock shifts have the obvious disadvantage of complexity. People must remember to change their clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely.\[167\] People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive.\[168\] During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.\[169\]

[Willett_memorial.JPG](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Willett_memorial.JPG "fig:Willett_memorial.JPG") Memorial Sundial is always on DST.\]\]

Damage to a German steel facility occurred during a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system linked to a radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured.\[170\] Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care.\[171\] These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks.\[172\] A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the [Coordinated Universal Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "wikilink") (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, [Unix](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "wikilink")-based computer systems use the UTC-based [Unix time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time "wikilink") internally.

Some clock-shift problems could be avoided by adjusting clocks continuously\[173\] or at least more gradually\[174\]—for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions—but this would add complexity and has never been implemented.

DST inherits and can magnify the disadvantages of [standard time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_time "wikilink"). For example, when reading a [sundial](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/sundial "wikilink"), one must compensate for it along with time zone and natural discrepancies.\[175\] Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect.\[176\]

## Terminology

As explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the (American) National Council of Teachers of English, the form *daylight savings time* (with an "s") was already in 1978 much more common than the older form *daylight saving time* in American English ("the change has been virtually accomplished"). Nevertheless, even dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford, which describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first. This is because the older form is still very common in print and preferred by many editors. ("Although *daylight saving time* is considered correct, *daylight savings time* (with an "s") is commonly used.")\[177\] The first two words are sometimes hyphenated (*daylight-saving(s) time*). Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms **daylight saving** (without "time"), **daylight savings** (without "time"), and **daylight time**.<ref name=variants>*Daylight saving time* and its variants:

  -
  -
  -
  - [Oxford Dictionaries](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/daylight-saving-time) "also **daylight savings time**"

  - </ref> The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style explains the development and current situation as follows: "Although the singular form *daylight saving time* is the original one, dating from the early 20th century—and is preferred by some usage critics—the plural form is now extremely common in AmE. \[...\] The rise of *daylight savings time* appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue: when *saving* is used, readers might puzzle momentarily over whether *saving* is a gerund (the saving of daylight) or a participle (the time for saving). \[...\] Using *savings* as the adjective—as in *savings account* or *savings bond*—makes perfect sense. More than that, it ought to be accepted as the better form."\[178\]

In Britain, Willett's 1907 proposal\[179\] used the term *daylight saving*, but by 1911 the term *summer time* replaced *daylight saving time* in draft legislation.\[180\] The same or similar expressions are used in many other languages: *Sommerzeit* in German, *zomertijd* in Dutch, *kesäaika* in Finnish, *horario de verano* or *hora de verano* in Spanish, and *[heure d'été](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/w:fr:heure_d'été "wikilink")* in French.\[181\]

The name of local time typically changes when DST is observed. American English replaces *standard* with *daylight*: for example, *[Pacific Standard Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone "wikilink")* (*PST*) becomes *Pacific Daylight Time* (*PDT*). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is *[British Summer Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time "wikilink")* (BST), and British English typically inserts *summer* into other time zone names, e.g. *[Central European Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time "wikilink")* (*CET*) becomes *[Central European Summer Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Summer_Time "wikilink")* (*CEST*).

The North American English mnemonic "spring forward, fall back" (also "spring ahead ...", "spring up ...", and "... fall behind") helps people remember in which direction to shift the clocks.\[182\]

The clock uses Roman numerals and the man is dressed in stripped-down Roman gladiator style. The text says \"You can't stop time... But you can turn it back one hour at 2 a.m. on Oct. 28 when daylight-saving time ends and standard time begins.\"| A 2001 US public service advertisement reminded people to adjust clocks.")

Changes to DST rules cause problems in existing computer installations. For example, the [2007 change to DST rules](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005#Change_to_daylight_saving_time "wikilink") in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded, with the greatest impact on e-mail and calendar programs. The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate [information technologists](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology "wikilink").\[183\]

Some applications standardize on UTC to avoid problems with clock shifts and time zone differences.\[184\] Likewise, most modern operating systems internally handle and store all times as UTC and only convert to local time for display.\[185\]\[186\]

However, even if UTC is used internally, the systems still require external [leap second](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/leap_second "wikilink") updates and time zone information to correctly calculate local time as needed. Many systems in use today base their date/time calculations from data derived from the [tz database](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/tz_database "wikilink") also known as **zoneinfo**.

### IANA time zone database

The [tz database](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/tz_database "wikilink") maps a name to the named location's historical and predicted clock shifts. This database is used by many computer software systems, including most [Unix-like](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "wikilink") operating systems, [Java](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_\(Sun\) "wikilink"), and the [Oracle RDBMS](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_RDBMS "wikilink");\[187\] [HP](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard "wikilink")'s "tztab" database is similar but incompatible.\[188\] When temporal authorities change DST rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance. In Unix-like systems the TZ [environment variable](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/environment_variable "wikilink") specifies the [location name](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones_by_name "wikilink"), as in `TZ=':America/New_York'`. In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the  file, which is usually a [symbolic link](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/symbolic_link "wikilink") or [hard link](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/hard_link "wikilink") to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in timezone-independent [epoch time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/epoch_time "wikilink"); the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.

Older or stripped-down systems may support only the TZ values required by [POSIX](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX "wikilink"), which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value. For example, `TZ='EST5EDT,M3.2.0/02:00,M11.1.0/02:00'` specifies time for the eastern United States starting in 2007. Such a TZ value must be changed whenever DST rules change, and the new value applies to all years, mishandling some older timestamps.\[189\]

### Microsoft Windows

As with zoneinfo, a user of [Microsoft Windows](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "wikilink") configures DST by specifying the name of a location, and the operating system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows.\[190\] [Windows Vista](../Page/Windows_Vista.md "wikilink") supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.\[191\]

These limitations have caused problems. For example, before 2005, DST in [Israel](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "wikilink") varied each year and was skipped some years. [Windows 95](../Page/Windows_95.md "wikilink") used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In [Windows 98](../Page/Windows_98.md "wikilink"), Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 [Israeli Daylight Saving Law](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Daylight_Saving_Law "wikilink") established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year\[192\] and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically.\[193\] In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the [Gregorian calendar](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "wikilink").\[194\]

Microsoft Windows keeps the system [real-time clock](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/real-time_clock "wikilink") in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when [multi booting](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/multi_boot "wikilink") with operating systems that set the clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a [Windows registry](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_registry "wikilink") entry <var>RealTimeIsUniversal</var> that had been introduced many years earlier, when [Windows NT](../Page/Windows_NT.md "wikilink") supported [RISC](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC "wikilink") machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained.\[195\] Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.\[196\]\[197\]

The [NTFS](../Page/NTFS.md "wikilink") file system used by recent versions of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the [FAT](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table "wikilink") filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied from the hard disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some [file archivers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/file_archiver "wikilink"). It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect should be kept in mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a [checksum algorithm](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/checksum_algorithm "wikilink")). A ready clue is if the time stamps differ by precisely 1 hour.

## Permanent daylight saving time

A move to "permanent daylight saving time" (staying on summer hours all year with no time shifts) is sometimes advocated and is currently implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina, Belarus,\[198\] Canada (e.g. [Saskatchewan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Saskatchewan "wikilink")), Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Morocco, Namibia, Singapore, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\[199\] It could be a result of following the timezone of a neighbouring region, political will, or other causes. Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly time shifts. However, many remain unconvinced of the benefits, citing the same problems and the relatively late sunrises, particularly in winter, that year-round DST entails.\[200\]

Russia switched to permanent DST from 2011 to 2014, but the move proved unpopular because of the late sunrises in winter, so the country switched permanently back to standard time in 2014 for the whole Russian Federation.\[201\] The United Kingdom and Ireland also experimented with year-round summer time between 1968 and 1971, and put clocks forward by an extra hour during [World War II](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "wikilink").\[202\]

In the United States, the Florida legislature passed a bill to enact permanent DST; and California,\[203\] Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island have introduced proposals or commissions to that effect.\[204\] Although 26 states have considered making DST permanent, unless Congress changes federal law, states can not implement permanent DST—states can only opt out of DST, not standard time.\[205\]

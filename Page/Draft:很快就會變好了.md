"**Soon You'll Get Better**" is a song by American singer-songwriter [Taylor Swift](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift "wikilink") from her seventh studio album, *[Lover](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lover_\(album\) "wikilink")* (2019). It features background vocals from the [Dixie Chicks](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Chicks "wikilink") and was written and produced by Swift and [Jack Antonoff](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Antonoff "wikilink"). The song was released with the album on August 23, 2019. "Soon You'll Get Better" has been described as a [country](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "wikilink") song, and has been compared to "The Best Day", a song from Swift's 2008 album *[Fearless](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_\(Taylor_Swift_album\) "wikilink")*, in both style and in subject matter; both focus on Swift's relationship with her mother.\[1\]\[2\]

## Background and composition

The song is about the battles Swift's parents have had with [cancer](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/cancer "wikilink"), and specifically on her mother's latest diagnosis of breast cancer.\[3\]\[4\] In a live video broadcast on [YouTube](../Page/YouTube.md "wikilink") the day before the album's release, Swift told fans that the song was the hardest on the album to write, adding that the choice to publish it was made in a family discussion because of how personal it is.\[5\] Fans who were invited to Swift's Secret Sessions have reported that she left the room when the song played.\[6\]

It is seen as a country song: *[Rolling Stone](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "wikilink")* call it "stripped-down", noting that the only music in the acoustic song is provided by sparse strings,\[7\] with [*Time*](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "wikilink") favorably describing the track as a "tilt back to \[Swift's\] country roots"\[8\] and *[USA Today](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today "wikilink")* saying it has a "Nashville feel".\[9\] The song features country trio the Dixie Chicks; a picture of the group was shown in the music video for the album's lead single "[Me\!](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me! "wikilink")".\[10\] Swift previously performed with the Dixie Chicks shortly after her mother's first cancer diagnosis, and has cited the album [*Fly*](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_\(Dixie_Chicks_album\) "wikilink") as an influence for the production of the *Lover* album.\[11\]

## Critical reception

The Song was acclaimed by critics, being noted as a highlight from the album.

*Time* has called the song "heart-wrenching",\[12\] with *Rolling Stone* saying that it contains the "most vulnerable lyrics Swift has written in her entire career".\[13\] *USA Today* said that it ranked among her saddest songs, referring to her previous charity single "[Ronan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronan_\(song\) "wikilink")", also about cancer.\[14\]

*Rolling Stone* complimented that lack of powerful instruments allowed Swift's personal memories to be the focus on the song, with the Dixie Chicks' background vocals serving this further and echoing the internal struggle the lyrics indicate.\[15\] *USA Today* said that there was no better song on the album for the collaboration.\[16\] *[The Guardian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "wikilink")*, which overall gave the album a mixed review, referred to the track as "a gorgeous, hushed country ballad about \[Swift's\] mother's illness, bedecked with banjo, fiddle and backing vocals by the Dixie Chicks" perfect for "\[t\]hose who think it all went wrong when she left Nashville" to "console themselves with".\[17\]

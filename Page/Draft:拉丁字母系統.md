The **Latin** or **Roman alphabet** is the [writing
system](../Page/文字.md "wikilink") originally used by the [ancient
Romans](../Page/古罗马.md "wikilink") to write the [Latin
language](../Page/拉丁语.md "wikilink").

## Etymology

Due to its use in writing Germanic, Romance, and other languages first
in Europe and then in other parts of the world, and due to its use in
[Romanizing](../Page/罗马化.md "wikilink") writing of other languages, it
has become widespread (see [Latin script](../Page/拉丁字母.md "wikilink")).
It is also used officially in China (separate from its
[ideographic](../Page/形意符号.md "wikilink") writing) and has been adopted
by Baltic and some Slavic states.

The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar [Cumaean Greek
version](../Page/優卑亞字母.md "wikilink") of the [Greek
alphabet](../Page/希腊字母.md "wikilink"), which was itself descended
from the [Phoenician](../Page/腓尼基字母.md "wikilink")
[abjad](../Page/辅音音素文字.md "wikilink"), which in turn derived
from [Egyptian
hieroglyphics](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/圣书体 "wikilink").\[1\]
The [Etruscans](../Page/伊特拉斯坎文明.md "wikilink"), who [ruled early
Rome](../Page/羅馬歷史.md "wikilink"), adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet,
which was modified over time to become the [Etruscan
alphabet](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/古意大利字母 "wikilink"), which was in
turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin
alphabet.

During the [Middle Ages](../Page/中世纪.md "wikilink"), the Latin alphabet
was used (sometimes with modifications) for writing [Romance
languages](../Page/罗曼语族.md "wikilink"), which are direct descendants of
[Latin](../Page/拉丁语.md "wikilink"), as well as
[Celtic](../Page/凯尔特语族.md "wikilink"),
[Germanic](../Page/日耳曼语族.md "wikilink"),
[Baltic](../Page/波罗的语族.md "wikilink"), and some [Slavic
languages](../Page/斯拉夫语族.md "wikilink"). With the [age of
colonialism](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_European_colonization_wave_\(15th_century–19th_century\) "wikilink")
and [Christian evangelism](../Page/傳福音.md "wikilink"), the [Latin
script](../Page/拉丁字母.md "wikilink") spread beyond
[Europe](../Page/欧洲.md "wikilink"), coming into use for writing
indigenous [American](../Page/美洲原住民語言.md "wikilink"),
[Australian](../Page/澳大利亚原住民语言.md "wikilink"),
[Austronesian](../Page/南島語系.md "wikilink"),
[Austroasiatic](../Page/南亚语系.md "wikilink"), and
[African](../Page/非洲语言.md "wikilink") languages. More recently,
[linguists](../Page/语言学.md "wikilink") have also tended to prefer the
Latin script or the [International Phonetic
Alphabet](../Page/國際音標.md "wikilink") (itself largely based on
the Latin script) when transcribing or creating written standards for
non-European languages, such as the [African reference
alphabet](../Page/非洲参考字母.md "wikilink").

The term *Latin alphabet* may refer to either the alphabet used to write
Latin (as described in this article), or other alphabets based on the
[Latin script](../Page/拉丁字母.md "wikilink"), which is the basic set of
letters common to the various alphabets descended from the classical
Latin alphabet, such as the [English
alphabet](../Page/英文字母.md "wikilink"). These [Latin-script
alphabets](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-script_alphabet "wikilink")
may discard letters, like the [Rotokas
alphabet](../Page/羅托卡特字母.md "wikilink"), or add new letters,
like the
[Danish](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_orthography "wikilink")
and
[Norwegian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_orthography "wikilink")
alphabets. [Letter](../Page/字母.md "wikilink") shapes have evolved over
the centuries, including the development in [Medieval
Latin](../Page/中世纪拉丁语.md "wikilink") of
[lower-case](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/字母大小写 "wikilink"), forms
which did not exist in the Classical period alphabet. English is the
only major modern [European language](../Page/欧洲语言.md "wikilink")
requiring no [diacritics](../Page/附加符号.md "wikilink") for native words
(although a [diaeresis](../Page/分音符.md "wikilink") may be used in words
such as "coöperation").\[2\]\[3\]

## History

### Origins

It is generally believed that the [Romans](../Page/古罗马.md "wikilink")
adopted the [Cumae alphabet](../Page/優卑亞字母.md "wikilink"), a variant of
the [Greek alphabet](../Page/希腊字母.md "wikilink"), in the 7th century BC
from [Cumae](../Page/庫邁.md "wikilink"), a [Greek
colony](../Page/大希腊.md "wikilink") in [Southern
Italy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/意大利南部 "wikilink"). ([Gaius Julius
Hyginus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/许癸努斯 "wikilink") in *Fab. 277*
mentions the legend that it was [Carmenta](../Page/卡尔门蒂斯.md "wikilink"),
the [Cimmerian
Sibyl](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimmerian_Sibyl "wikilink"), who
altered fifteen letters of the Greek alphabet to become the Latin
alphabet, which her son
[Evander](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_of_Pallene "wikilink")
introduced into Latium, supposedly 60 years before the [Trojan
War](../Page/特洛伊战争.md "wikilink"), but there is no historically sound
basis to this tale.) The Ancient Greek alphabet was in turn based upon
the [Phoenician](../Page/腓尼基字母.md "wikilink")
[abjad](../Page/辅音音素文字.md "wikilink"). From the Cumae
alphabet, the [Etruscan
alphabet](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/古意大利字母 "wikilink")
was derived and the Romans eventually adopted 21 of the original 27
Etruscan letters:

#### Old Latin alphabet

Latin included 21 different characters. The letter  was the western form
of the Greek [gamma](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Γ "wikilink"), but it
was used for the sounds  and  alike, possibly under the influence of
[Etruscan](../Page/伊特拉斯坎語.md "wikilink"), which might have lacked any
voiced [plosives](../Page/塞音.md "wikilink"). Later, probably during the
3rd century BC, the letter  – unneeded to write Latin properly – was
replaced with the new letter , a  modified with a small vertical stroke,
which took its place in the alphabet. From then on,  represented the
[voiced](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/清濁音 "wikilink") plosive , while
was generally reserved for the voiceless plosive . The letter  was used
only rarely, in a small number of words such as
*[Kalendae](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalends "wikilink")*, often
interchangeably with .

in this first-century inscription are very light. (There is one over the
 in the first line.) The vowel *I* is written taller rather than taking
an apex. The interpuncts are comma-shaped, an elaboration of a more
typical triangular shape. From the [shrine of the
Augustales](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodales_Augustales "wikilink")
at [Herculaneum](../Page/赫库兰尼姆古城.md "wikilink").\]\] After the [Roman
conquest of Greece](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/希腊的罗马时期 "wikilink") in
the 1st century BC, Latin adopted the Greek letters  and  (or readopted,
in the latter case) to write
[Greek](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/希腊语 "wikilink") loanwords,
placing them at the end of the alphabet. An attempt by the emperor
[Claudius](../Page/克勞狄一世.md "wikilink") to introduce three [additional
letters](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudian_letters "wikilink") did
not last. Thus it was during the [classical
Latin](../Page/古典拉丁語.md "wikilink") period that the Latin
alphabet contained 23 letters:

The Latin names of some of these letters are disputed; for example,  may
have been called
<span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[\[ˈaha](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:拉丁語國際音標 "wikilink")\]</span>
or
<span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[\[ˈaka](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:拉丁語國際音標 "wikilink")\]</span>.\[4\]
In general the Romans did not use the traditional
([Semitic](../Page/腓尼基字母.md "wikilink")-derived) names as in
Greek: the names of the [plosives](../Page/塞音.md "wikilink") were formed
by adding  to their sound (except for  and , which needed different
vowels to be distinguished from ) and the names of the
[continuants](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/持續音 "wikilink") consisted
either of the bare sound, or the sound preceded by .

The letter  when introduced was probably called "hy"  as in Greek, the
name [upsilon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Υ "wikilink") not being in
use yet, but this was changed to "i Graeca" (Greek i) as Latin speakers
had difficulty distinguishing its foreign sound  from .  was given its
Greek name, [zeta](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ζ "wikilink"). This
scheme has continued to be used by most modern European languages that
have adopted the Latin alphabet. For the Latin sounds represented by the
various letters see [Latin spelling and
pronunciation](../Page/拉丁语发音.md "wikilink"); for the names of
the letters in English see [English
alphabet](../Page/英文字母.md "wikilink").

[Diacritics](../Page/附加符号.md "wikilink") were not regularly used, but
they did occur sometimes, the most common being the apex used to mark
[long vowels](../Page/元音長度.md "wikilink"), which had previously
sometimes been written doubled. However, in place of taking an apex, the
letter i was written
[taller](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_i "wikilink"): . For
example, what is today transcribed *Lūciī a fīliī* was written  in the
inscription depicted.

The primary mark of punctuation was the
[interpunct](../Page/间隔号.md "wikilink"), which was used as a [word
divider](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/分字符 "wikilink"), though it fell
out of use after 200 AD.

[Old Roman
cursive](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Roman_cursive "wikilink")
script, also called
[majuscule](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/字母大小写 "wikilink")
cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used
for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by
schoolchildren learning the Latin alphabet, and even
[emperors](../Page/羅馬皇帝.md "wikilink") issuing commands. A more formal
style of writing was based on [Roman square
capitals](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_square_capitals "wikilink"),
but cursive was used for quicker, informal writing. It was most commonly
used from about the 1st century BC to the 3rd century, but it probably
existed earlier than that. It led to
[Uncial](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/安色尔体 "wikilink"), a
[majuscule](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/字母大小写 "wikilink") script
commonly used from the 3rd to 8th centuries AD by Latin and Greek
scribes.

[New Roman
cursive](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Roman_cursive "wikilink")
script, also known as
[minuscule](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/字母大小写 "wikilink")
cursive, was in use from the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses
letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; , , , and  had
taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters were proportionate to
each other. This script evolved into the medieval scripts known as
[Merovingian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merovingian_script "wikilink")
and [Carolingian
minuscule](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule "wikilink").

### Medieval and later developments

with the 23 letters. [J](../Page/J.md "wikilink"),
[U](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/U "wikilink") and
[W](../Page/W.md "wikilink") are missing.\]\]
[缩略图](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rekenaar_1553.jpg "fig:缩略图")
from [Nuremberg](../Page/纽伦堡.md "wikilink"), ca. 1553\]\] It was not
until the [Middle Ages](../Page/中世纪.md "wikilink") that the letter
(originally a [ligature](../Page/合字.md "wikilink") of two s) was added
to the Latin alphabet, to represent sounds from the [Germanic
languages](../Page/日耳曼语族.md "wikilink") which did not exist in medieval
Latin, and only after the [Renaissance](../Page/文艺复兴.md "wikilink") did
the convention of treating  and  as [vowels](../Page/元音.md "wikilink"),
and  and  as [consonants](../Page/辅音.md "wikilink"), become established.
Prior to that, the former had been merely
[allographs](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allography "wikilink") of the
latter. 

With the fragmentation of political power, the [style of
writing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/古文字学 "wikilink") changed and
varied greatly throughout the Middle Ages, even after the invention of
the [printing press](../Page/印刷机.md "wikilink"). Early deviations from
the classical forms were the [uncial
script](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/安色尔体 "wikilink"), a development of
the [Old Roman
cursive](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Roman_cursive "wikilink"),
and various so-called minuscule scripts that developed from [New Roman
cursive](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Roman_cursive "wikilink"), of
which the [Carolingian
minuscule](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule "wikilink")
was the most influential, introducing the [lower
case](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/字母大小写 "wikilink") forms of the
letters, as well as other writing conventions that have since become
standard.

The languages that use the [Latin script](../Page/拉丁字母.md "wikilink")
generally use [capital
letters](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/字母大小写 "wikilink") to
begin paragraphs and sentences and [proper
nouns](../Page/名詞.md "wikilink"). The rules for
[capitalization](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/capitalization "wikilink")
have changed over time, and different languages have varied in their
rules for capitalization. [Old
English](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/古英语 "wikilink"), for
example, was rarely written with even proper nouns capitalized, whereas
[Modern English](../Page/現代英語.md "wikilink") writers and printers of the
17th and 18th century frequently capitalized most and sometimes all
nouns,\[5\] which is still systematically done in Modern
[German](../Page/德语.md "wikilink"), e.g. in the preamble and all of the
United States Constitution: *We the People of the United States, in
Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic
Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general
Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our
Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United
States of America.*

### Spread

[缩略图](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Latin_alphabet_world_distribution.svg "fig:缩略图")
The Latin alphabet spread, along with the [Latin
language](../Page/拉丁语.md "wikilink"), from the [Italian
Peninsula](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/意大利半島 "wikilink") to the lands
surrounding the [Mediterranean Sea](../Page/地中海.md "wikilink") with the
expansion of the [Roman Empire](../Page/羅馬帝國.md "wikilink"). The eastern
half of the Empire, including [Greece](../Page/希腊.md "wikilink"),
[Turkey](../Page/土耳其.md "wikilink"), the
[Levant](../Page/黎凡特.md "wikilink"), and
[Egypt](../Page/埃及.md "wikilink"), continued to use
[Greek](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/希腊语 "wikilink") as a [lingua
franca](../Page/通用语.md "wikilink"), but Latin was widely spoken in the
western half, and as the western [Romance
languages](../Page/罗曼语族.md "wikilink") evolved out of Latin,
they continued to use and adapt the Latin alphabet.

With the spread of [Western
Christianity](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/西方基督教 "wikilink") during
the [Middle Ages](../Page/中世纪.md "wikilink"), the script was gradually
adopted by the peoples of [northern Europe](../Page/北歐.md "wikilink")
who spoke [Celtic languages](../Page/海島凱爾特語支.md "wikilink") (displacing
the [Ogham](../Page/歐甘字母.md "wikilink") alphabet) or [Germanic
languages](../Page/日耳曼语族.md "wikilink") (displacing earlier [Runic
alphabets](../Page/盧恩字母.md "wikilink")), [Baltic
languages](../Page/波罗的语族.md "wikilink"), as well as by the
speakers of several [Uralic languages](../Page/乌拉尔语系.md "wikilink"),
most notably [Hungarian](../Page/匈牙利语.md "wikilink"),
[Finnish](../Page/芬兰语.md "wikilink") and
[Estonian](../Page/爱沙尼亚语.md "wikilink"). The Latin alphabet
came into use for writing the [West Slavic
languages](../Page/西斯拉夫语支.md "wikilink") and several [South
Slavic languages](../Page/南斯拉夫语支.md "wikilink"), as the people who spoke
them adopted [Roman Catholicism](../Page/天主教會.md "wikilink").

Later, it was adopted by non-Catholic countries.
[Romanian](../Page/羅馬尼亞語.md "wikilink"), most of whose
speakers are Eastern Orthodox, was the first major language to switch
from Cyrillic to Latin script, doing so in the 19th century, although
[Moldova](../Page/摩尔多瓦.md "wikilink") only did so after the Soviet
collapse.

It has also been increasingly adopted by majority Muslim
[Turkic-speaking](../Page/突厥语族.md "wikilink") countries, beginning with
[Turkey](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/土耳其语字母 "wikilink") in the 1920s.
After the Soviet collapse, [Azerbaijan](../Page/阿塞拜疆.md "wikilink"),
[Turkmenistan](../Page/土库曼斯坦.md "wikilink"), and
[Uzbekistan](../Page/乌兹别克斯坦.md "wikilink") all switched from
Cyrillic to Latin. The [Kazakh
government](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_government "wikilink")
announced in 2015 that the Latin alphabet will replace
[Cyrillic](../Page/西里尔字母.md "wikilink") as the writing system for the
Kazakh language by 2025.\[6\]

Asian countries see the lowest proportion of people using Latin script
relative to alternative scripts.

The spread of the Latin alphabet among previously illiterate peoples has
inspired the creation of new writing systems, such as the
[Avoiuli](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoiuli "wikilink") alphabet in
[Vanuatu](../Page/瓦努阿图.md "wikilink"), which replaces the letters of the
Latin alphabet with alternative symbols.

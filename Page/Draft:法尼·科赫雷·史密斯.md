**Fanny Cochrane Smith** (December 1834 – 24 February 1905) was an
[Aboriginal
Tasmanian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Tasmanian "wikilink"),
born in December 1834. She is considered to be the last fluent speaker
of a [Tasmanian
language](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_languages "wikilink"),
and her [wax
cylinder](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wax_cylinder "wikilink")
recordings of songs are the only audio recordings of any of
[Tasmania](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "wikilink")'s
indigenous languages. Her recordings were inducted into the UNESCO
[Australian Memory of the World
Register](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_of_the_World_Register_–_Asia_and_the_Pacific "wikilink")

范妮科克倫史密斯，他出生在1834年12月。他考慮成為最後一個塔斯馬尼亞語的流利演講者

，以及他歌曲的錄音是僅剩的土著語言。他的錄音被錄選進聯合國教科文組織在2017年 Although there has been dispute
as to whether she or
[Truganini](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truganini "wikilink") was the
last full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal, Smith was officially recognised
as the last Tasmanian Aboriginal by the Government in
1889.\[2\]雖然曾經被爭議為她是否為最後一個精力旺盛的塔斯馬尼亞原住民，史密斯已正式的被政府認可為最後一個塔斯馬尼亞原住民在1889年。

## Early life

Fanny Cochrane's mother and father, Tanganutura and Nicermenic, were two
of the Tasmanian Aboriginals settled on [Flinders
Island](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island "wikilink") in the
1830s by the Rev. [George Augustus
Robinson](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Augustus_Robinson "wikilink"),
and she was born at Settlement Point (or Wybalenna, meaning Black Man's
House) on [Flinders
Island](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island "wikilink"). No
indigenous name is known; Robinson gave European names to all the
Indigenous Tasmanians who arrived at the Island as part of his attempt
to suppress their culture.\[3\]\[4\]

From the age of five to eight she lived in the home of Robert Clark, the
Wybalenna preacher, and was then sent to the orphan school in
[Hobart](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobart "wikilink") to learn
domestic service skills after which she returned to Wybalenna. She
served as Clark's servant until the station closed in 1847. In 1847 her
parents, along with the survivors of Wybalenna were removed to [Oyster
Cove](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_Cove,_Tasmania "wikilink").
Note that there is no evidence that Nicermenic was the father – who is
probably unknown – Nicermenic was not on Flinders Island in the
1830s.\[5\] In June 1834, the year of Fanny's birth on Flinders Island,
he was reported to Robinson as being involved in stealing a boat on the
Leven River on the NW Coast with Probelatter.\[6\]

## Family

In 1854, Fanny married William Smith, an English
[sawyer](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:sawyer "wikilink") and
[ex-convict](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict "wikilink"), and
between 1855 and 1880 they had 11 children.\[7\]

Following her marriage, Fanny and her husband ran a boarding-house in
Hobart. After receiving a government annuity of £24 and a land grant of
, she selected land near Oyster Cove to be near her mother, sister and
brother and the couple moved there shortly before their first child was
born. The Smiths grew their own food but derived their income from
timber.

## Final years

Following the death of
[Truganini](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truganini "wikilink") in 1876,
Fanny laid claim to be "the last Tasmanian". The government of the
[Colony of
Tasmania](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Tasmania "wikilink")
recognised this claim in 1889 and granted her  of land and increased her
annuity to £50. She became a
[Methodist](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism "wikilink") and gave
the land needed to build a Methodist church at Nicholls Rivulet, which
opened in 1901.\[8\]

Cochrane Smith died of
[pneumonia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/pneumonia "wikilink") and
[pleurisy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/pleurisy "wikilink") at [Port
Cygnet](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnet,_Tasmania "wikilink"),
from Oyster Cove, on 24 February 1905. There was some dispute at the
time of her death as to whether she or
[Truganini](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truganini "wikilink") was the
last Tasmanian Aboriginal person. But was officially recognised by the
Government in 1889 as the last Tasmanian Aborigine about 30 years after
Truganini passed.\[9\]

In 1898, [Henry Ling
Roth](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ling_Roth "wikilink")
published a paper in the *[Journal of the Royal Anthropological
Institute](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_the_Royal_Anthropological_Institute "wikilink")*
examining Smith's claim to be a "full-blood" Aboriginal Tasmanian. He
did not examine her personally, but compared locks of her hair with
samples of earlier Tasmanians, and conducted a photographic comparison
of her and Truganini. Roth concluded that Smith was actually mixed-race,
as she had "Europeanised" facial characteristics, much lighter skin than
Truganini, and hair that was "wavy" rather than
"[woolly](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-textured_hair "wikilink")".\[10\]

Five cylinders were cut, however by 1949 only four remained as "A fifth
cylinder, on which was recorded the translation of the songs, was broken
some time ago".\[12\] Upon hearing her own performance, Smith had cried
"My poor race. What have I done",\[13\] she believed the voice to be
that of her mother.\[14\]

The recording of Smith's songs was the subject of a 1998 song by
Australian folk singer [Bruce
Watson](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Watson_\(songwriter\) "wikilink"),

Phonograph](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Phonograph_Company "wikilink")*.
Watson is the great grandson of Horace Watson, who recorded Fanny in
1903.\[15\]\[16\]

the collection of the [National Museum of

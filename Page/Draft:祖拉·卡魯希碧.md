**祖拉·卡魯希碧** (約1925年– 2018年12月17日)
是一名盧安達婦女，在1994年盧安達大屠殺期間拯救了100多人免遭胡圖族的民兵殺害。

## 早期生活

卡魯希碧的出生日期尚不清楚，有些消息來源大約於1909年，但根據她的州身份證上所述的日期認為她出生於1925年左右。 \[1\]\[2\]
Her family were [traditional
healers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_healer "wikilink") in the
village of Musamo in [Ruhango
District](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhango_District "wikilink"),
around an hour's drive from the nation's capital of
[Kigali](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigali "wikilink").\[3\]\[4\]
Karuhimbi also became a healer and gained a reputation for having
magical powers.\[5\]\[6\] During the [Rwandan
Revolution](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Revolution "wikilink")
she witnessed violence between the ruling minority
[Tutsis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutsi "wikilink") and the more
numerous [Hutu](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutu "wikilink") tribe.
She later claimed that in 1959 she had saved the life of a two-year-old
Tutsi boy by tying beads from her necklace into his hair so that he
could pass as a girl and escape execution by the Hutus. Karuhimbi
claimed that the boy grew up to become Rwandan president [Paul
Kagame](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kagame "wikilink").\[7\]

## 1994的大屠殺

dedicated to Zura Karuhimbi at the  in
[Padua](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padua "wikilink"), Italy.\]\]

At the time of the 1994 [Rwandan
genocide](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide "wikilink"), a
resurgence of tribal violence that killed more than 800,000 people,
Karuhimbi was an elderly widow.\[8\] She helped Tutsis as well as
[Burundians](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi "wikilink") and three
Europeans to hide from roving Hutu militias. Karuhimbi hid the refugees
inside her two-room house, and possibly in a hole in her fields. In all
she saved more than 100 people, including babies that she rescued from
the arms of their dead mothers.\[9\]

To deter the Hutu militias Karuhimbi cultivated a reputation for being
possessed by evil spirits.\[10\] To maintain her appearances as a
"witch" she painted herself and her house with natural herbs that, when
touched, acted as an irritant.\[11\]\[12\] Karuhimbi claimed her house
was inhabited by ghosts and threatened that those who tried to enter
would unleash evil spirits and the wrath of God upon
themselves.\[13\]\[14\] She emphasised her warnings by jangling her
bracelet-laden arms and threatening that if any refugees were killed
inside her house then the murderers would be "digging their own
graves".\[15\] The militia attempted to bribe Karuhimbi to allow them
access to her home but she refused.\[16\] All those that sheltered with
Karuhimbi survived the genocide.\[17\]

在大屠殺之後，卡魯希碧聲明她是一名基督徒，她的巫術活動只不過是一種阻擋攻擊的手段。 In 2006 she was awarded
Rwanda's [Campaign Against Genocide
Medal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_Against_Genocide_Medal "wikilink")
by President Paul Kagame. Karuhimbi subsequently wore the medal at all
times, placing it beneath her pillow whilst she slept. In her later
years she continued to live in the same house she had used to shelter
refugees despite it crumbling with age. Poverty-stricken, she was cared
for by a niece. Karuhimbi died at her home on 17 December 2018.\[18\]

## Early life and education

Born in [Harlem, New York](../Page/哈莱姆.md "wikilink"), to
[Cuban](../Page/古巴.md "wikilink")\[2\] parents, John Carlos was a gifted
high school athlete and outstanding student who went on to study at  on
a full track-and-field scholarship. His victories in the 100- and
200-meter dash and as a member of the 4×400-meter relay helped lead ETSU
to the 1967  Championship. After his first year, Carlos enrolled at [San
Jose State University](../Page/聖荷西州立大學.md "wikilink") where he was
trained by future National Track & Field Hall of Fame coach, .

Carlos was awarded an honorary doctorate from [California State
University](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/加利福尼亞州立大學 "wikilink") in 2008.
In 2012, he was awarded honorary doctorates from his alma maters Texas
A\&M University-Commerce (formerly East Texas State University) and San
Jose State University.

## Olympics

The 1968  were held on the Californian side of Lake Tahoe at , which at
7,377 feet above sea level is approximately the same altitude as [Mexico
City](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968年夏季奥林匹克运动会 "wikilink").\[3\]\[4\]
Carlos won the 200-meter dash in 19.92 seconds, beating world-record
holder  and surpassing his record by 0.3 seconds. Though the record was
never ratified because the spike formation on Carlos' shoes ("brush
spikes") was not accepted at the time,\[5\] the race reinforced his
status as a world-class sprinter.

Carlos became a founding member of the  (OPHR), and originally advocated
a [boycott](../Page/杯葛.md "wikilink") of the 1968 Mexico City Olympic
Games unless four conditions were met: withdrawal of South Africa and
Rhodesia from the games, restoration of Muhammad Ali's world heavyweight
boxing title, [Avery Brundage](../Page/艾弗里·布伦戴奇.md "wikilink") to step
down as president of the IOC, and the hiring of more African-American
assistant coaches. As the boycott failed to achieve support after the
IOC withdrew invitations for South Africa and Rhodesia, he decided,
together with Smith, to participate but to stage a protest in case he
received a medal.\[6\] Following his third-place finish behind fellow
American Smith and Australian [Peter
Norman](../Page/彼得·諾曼.md "wikilink") in the 200 at the Mexico
Olympics, Carlos and Smith made headlines around the world by [raising
their black-gloved fists](../Page/1968年黑人權力致敬事件.md "wikilink") at the
medal award ceremony. Both athletes wore black socks and no shoes on the
podium to represent [African-American](../Page/非裔美国人.md "wikilink")
[poverty in the United States](../Page/美国贫困问题.md "wikilink"). In
support, Peter Norman, the silver medalist who was a white athlete from
Australia, participated in the protest by wearing an OPHR badge.

[John_Carlos,_Tommie_Smith,_Peter_Norman_1968cr.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Carlos,_Tommie_Smith,_Peter_Norman_1968cr.jpg "fig:John_Carlos,_Tommie_Smith,_Peter_Norman_1968cr.jpg");
both wear  badges. [Peter Norman](../Page/彼得·諾曼.md "wikilink") (silver
medalist, left) from Australia also wears an OPHR badge in solidarity
with Smith and Carlos.\]\] [International Olympic
Committee](../Page/国际奥林匹克委员会.md "wikilink") (IOC) president
[Avery Brundage](../Page/艾弗里·布伦戴奇.md "wikilink") deemed it to be a
domestic political statement unfit for the apolitical, international
forum the Olympic Games were intended to be. In response to their
actions, he ordered Smith and Carlos suspended from the US team and
banned from the Olympic Village. When the US Olympic Committee refused,
Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team. This threat led to
the expulsion of the two athletes from the Games.\[7\]

A spokesman for the IOC said Smith and Carlos's actions were "a
deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the
Olympic spirit."\[8\] Brundage, who was president of the United States
Olympic Committee in 1936, had made no objections against [Nazi
salutes](../Page/納粹禮.md "wikilink") during the [Berlin
Olympics](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936年夏季奥林匹克运动会 "wikilink"). He
argued that the Nazi salute, being a national salute at the time, was
acceptable in a competition of nations, while the athletes' salute was
not of a nation and therefore unacceptable.\[9\]

Carlos had his greatest year in track and field in 1969, equaling the
world 100-yard record of 9.1, winning the AAU 220-yard run, and leading
San Jose State to its first  with victories in the 100 and 220 and as a
member of the 4×110-yard relay. He was featured on the cover of **' May
1969 issue.\[10\]

He was also the gold medalist at 200 meters at the 1967 [Pan American
Games](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/泛美運動會 "wikilink") in [Winnipeg,
Manitoba](../Page/温尼伯.md "wikilink"), Canada and set indoor world bests
in the 60-yard dash (5.9) and the indoor 220-yard dash (21.2).\[11\]

the [Philadelphia Eagles](../Page/费城老鹰.md "wikilink") of the [National

He then went on to the [Canadian Football
League](../Page/加拿大加式足球聯盟.md "wikilink") where he
played one season for the .\[13\] Following his retirement from
football, Carlos worked for [Puma](../Page/PUMA.md "wikilink"), the

salute, at the 2008  held at  in Los Angeles, California.

On October 10, 2011, Carlos spoke and raised his fist at [Occupy Wall
Street](../Page/佔領華爾街.md "wikilink"). He said: "Today I am here for you.
Why? Because I am you. We're here forty-three years later because
there's a fight still to be won. This day is not for us but for our
children to come." The following day he appeared on
[MSNBC](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC "wikilink") and on 's

[Newtown](../Page/新镇_\(新南威尔士\).md "wikilink"). Silvio Offria, who
allowed an artist known only as "Donald" to paint the mural on his
house, said Norman came to Newtown to see the mural before he died in
2006, "He came and had his photo taken, he was very happy."\[20\]

In February 2019 he was the guest speaker at the WISTCA Clinic and
"owned Middleton for over an hour".

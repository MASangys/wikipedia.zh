***Formica rufa***, also known as the **red wood ant**, **southern wood
ant**, or **horse ant**, is a
[boreal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/boreal_ecosystem "wikilink")
member of the [*Formica rufa*
group](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica_rufa_group "wikilink") of
[ants](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ant "wikilink"), and is the [type
species](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_species "wikilink") for that
group. It is native to Europe and Anatolia\[1\] but is also found in
North America,\[2\] in both coniferous and broad-leaf broken woodland
and parkland.\[3\] Workers are bicolored red and brownish-black, with a
dorsal dark patch on the head and promensonotum,\[4\] and are
polymorphic, measuring 4.5–9 mm in length.\[5\] They have large
mandibles and like many other ant species they are able to spray [formic
acid](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/formic_acid "wikilink") from their
abdomens as a defence.\[6\] Formic acid was first extracted in 1671 by
the English naturalist [John
Ray](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ray "wikilink") by distilling a
large number of crushed ants of this species.\[7\]

## Description

Nests of these ants are large, conspicuous, dome-shaped mounds of grass,
twigs, or conifer needles,\[8\] often built against a rotting stump,
usually situated in woodland clearings where the sun's rays can reach
them. Large colonies may have 100,000 to 400,000 workers and 100
queens.\[9\] *F. rufa* is highly polygynous and often readopts
postnuptial queens from its own mother colony, leading to old,
multigallery nests which may contain well over a hundred egg-producing
females. These colonies can often measure several metres in height and
diameter. *F. rufa* is aggressively territorial, and often attacks and
removes other ant species from the area. [Nuptial
flights](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuptial_flight "wikilink") take
place during the springtime and are often marked by savage battles
between neighbouring colonies as territorial boundaries are
re-established.\[10\] New nests are established by budding from existing
nests in the spring,\[11\] or by the mechanism of temporary social
parasitism, the hosts being species of the *F. fusca* group, notably
*[F. fusca](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica_fusca "wikilink")* and
*[F. lemani](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica_lemani "wikilink")*,
although incipient *F. rufa* colonies have also been recorded from nests
of *[F.
glebaria](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica_glebaria "wikilink")*,
*[F.
cunnicularia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica_cunicularia "wikilink")*,
and similar species including the genus
*[Lasius](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasius "wikilink")*. An *F.
rufa* queen ousts the nest's existing queen, lays eggs, and the existing
workers care for her offspring until the nest is taken over.

## Diet

[Formica_rufa_nest_2.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Formica_rufa_nest_2.jpg "fig:Formica_rufa_nest_2.jpg")
[Ant-hill-in-Rila.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ant-hill-in-Rila.jpg "fig:Ant-hill-in-Rila.jpg")
The ant's primary diet is aphid honeydew, but they also prey on
invertebrates such as insects and arachnids;\[12\] they are voracious
scavengers. Foraging trails may extend 100 m.\[13\] Larger workers have
been observed to forage further away from the nest.\[14\] *F. rufa* is
commonly used in forestry and is often introduced into an area as a form
of pest management.

## Behaviour

### Worker behaviour

Worker ants in *F. rufa* have been observed to practice parental care or
perform cocoon nursing. A worker ant goes through a sensitive phase,
where it becomes accustomed to a chemical stimulus emitted by the
cocoon. The sensitive phase occurs at an early and specific period. An
experiment was conducted by Moli et al. to test how worker ants react to
different types of cocoon: homospecific and heterospecific cocoons. If
the worker ant is brought up in the absence of cocoons, it will show
neither recognition nor nursing behaviour. Both types of cocoons are
opened up by the workers and devoured for nutrients. When accustomed to
only the homospecific cocoons, the workers collect both types of
cocoons, but only place and protect the homospecific cocoons. The
heterospecific cocoons are neglected and abandoned in the nest and
eaten. Lastly, if heterospecific cocoons were injected with extract from
the homospecific cocoons, the workers tend to both types of cocoons
equally. This demonstrates that a chemical stimulus from the cocoons
seems to be of paramount importance in prompting adoption behaviour in
worker ants. However, the specific chemical / stimulus has not been
identified.\[15\]

### Foraging behaviour

The foraging behaviour of wood ants changes according to the
environment. Wood ants have been shown to tend and harvest
[aphids](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/aphids "wikilink") and prey on
and compete with other predators for food resources. They tend to prey
on the most plentiful members of the community whether they are in the
canopies of trees or in the forest foliage. Wood ants seem to favour
prey that lives in local canopies near their nest; however, when food
resources dwindle, they seek other trees further from the nests and
explore more trees instead of exploring the forest floor more
thoroughly.\[16\] This makes foraging for food significantly less
efficient, but the rest of the nest does not help the foraging
ants.\[17\]

### Kin behaviour

Wood ants have shown aggressive behaviour towards their own species in
certain situations.\[18\]\[19\] Intraspecific competition usually occurs
early in the spring between workers of competing nests. This aggression
may be linked to the protection of maintaining territory and trail. By
observing skirmishes and trail formation of wood ants, the territory
surrounding each nest differs between seasons. Permanent foraging trails
are reinforced each season and if another ant from an alien species
crossed it, hostile activity occurs. Most likely, the territory changes
based on foraging patterns are influenced by seasonal changes.\[20\]

Ants recognize their nestmates through chemical signals. Failure in
recognition causes the colony integrity to decay. Heavy metals
accumulated through the environment alter the aggression levels.\[21\]
This could be due to a variety of factors such as changes in
physiological effect or changes in resource levels. The ants in these
territories tend to be less productive and efficient. Increased resource
competition would be expected to increase level of aggression, but this
is not the case.

An experiment was conducted by Moli to perceive how the wood ant diet
can affect nest mate recognition. *Formica rufa* was housed in a lab
under an artificial diet for either seven or 30 days in the presence of
homo – colonial queens. After the allotted time, the workers were placed
back into their original nests to observe either acceptance or
rejection. The wood ants kept in the lab for only seven days were
recognized; however, the nestmates attacked the wood ants that were kept
in the lab for 30 days. Further, a greater degree of aggression was
witnessed for those that were heterospecific compared to those that were
homospecific. Moli concluded that workers would constantly learn the
chemical cues emitted and that the diet of the ants affects the colony
odor and in relation, nestmate identification.\[22\]

## Colony structure

Different types of *F. rufa* group species have demonstrated different
types of social interaction. Some groups are highly polygynous, with
multiple queen colonies forming large networks of connected nests.
Others are monogynous, with single-queen colonies. Different *F. rufa*
ants from different regions have been recorded as having traits of being
both polygynous and monogynous. The females in the *F. rufa* colonies
that are monogynous separate by flight and establish new nests. Queens
in polygynous nests form new nests in the vicinity of the original nest
with the help of workers.\[23\] Through evolution, polygyny may have
arisen through monogyny. One possibility is that monogynous nests due to
environmental and physiological conditions may take up new
queens.\[24\]\[25\] Sometimes in monogynous nests, daughters are
recruited as new reproductives and the nest becomes polygynous.\[26\]

### Nest splitting

Wood ants typically have multiple nests so they can move around in case
of drastic changes in the environment. This splitting of nests causes
the creation of multiple daughter nests. Several reasons occur as to why
wood ants move, such as a change in availability of food resources,
attack by the population of another colony, or a change in the state of
the nest itself. During this time, workers, queens, and the brood are
transferred from the original nest to the daughter nest in a bilateral
direction. The goal is to move to the daughter nest; but the
transporting ants may bring an individual back to the original nest. The
splitting process can last from a week to over a month.\[27\]

### Population

Turnover rate of wood ant nests is very quick. Within a period of three
years, Klimetzek counted 248 nests. Furthermore, no evidence of a
correlation between nest age and mortality was found. Smaller nests had
lower life expectancy compared to larger nests. The size of the nests
increased as the nest aged.\[28\]

## Bee paralysis virus

In 2008, the [chronic bee paralysis
virus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/chronic_bee_paralysis_virus "wikilink")
(CBPV) was reported for the first time in this and another species of
ants, *[Camponotus
vagus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camponotus_vagus "wikilink")*. CBPV
affects [bees](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/bee "wikilink"), ants, and
[mites](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/mite "wikilink").\[29\]

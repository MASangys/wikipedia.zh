，阿基米德死于[第二次布匿战争中](../Page/第二次布匿战争.md "wikilink")，当时[马克卢斯将军领导的罗马军队在历时两年](../Page/马克卢斯.md "wikilink")[攻城戰后下占领了锡拉库扎城](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/攻城戰 "wikilink")。根据来自[普魯塔克的知名说法](../Page/普魯塔克.md "wikilink")：当城市被占领时，阿基米德还在思考一个问题。一名罗马士兵要求他去面见马克卢斯将军。他拒绝了，说要完成这个难题。士兵愤怒难当，挥剑杀死了阿基米德。关于阿基米德之死，普魯塔克的一个说法认为他在尝试向罗马士兵投降的时候死亡。按照这个故事，阿基米德当时携带着数学仪器，士兵以为是什么贵重物件，因而杀了他。依记载，马克卢斯将军对阿基米德之死感到很生气，他认为阿基米德是重要的科学家并下令不得伤害他。\[11\]马克卢斯曾称阿基米德为“几何学的[巨人](../Page/百臂巨人.md "wikilink")”。\[12\]

相传阿基米德的遗言是“别打扰我的圆圈”，指当时他被罗马士兵打扰时正在研究的数学画图法中的圆圈。在[拉丁语中常作](../Page/拉丁语.md "wikilink")“”，但没有确凿证据表明阿基米德确实说了这些话，这在普魯塔克的说法中也没有出现。公元1世纪，[瓦莱里乌斯·马克西姆斯在](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/瓦莱里乌斯·马克西姆斯 "wikilink")《难忘的事迹名言》（英：*Memorable

阿基米德死后很久，古罗马历史学家写下了他的故事，也是我们为今所知的版本。锡拉库扎攻城一役由[波利比烏斯载于其](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/波利比烏斯 "wikilink")《[通史](../Page/歷史_\(波利比烏斯\).md "wikilink")》中，约在阿基米德死后70年写就，后被普鲁塔克和[蒂托·李维引用](../Page/蒂托·李维.md "wikilink")。此文主要着墨与其为保卫城市所建的“战争机器”，但未有详述阿基米德为人。\[16\]

最著名的阿基米德
[轶事是关于他发明不规则物体的体积测算法的故事](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/轶事 "wikilink")。按
[维特鲁威所述](../Page/维特鲁威.md "wikilink")，
[希伦二世下令让人制作了贡献给寺庙的金冠](../Page/希伦二世.md "wikilink")，他提供了纯[金](../Page/金.md "wikilink")。他要阿基米德确定不诚实的金匠是否用了[银替代了他的金子](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/银 "wikilink")。\[17\]
为了在不损坏金冠的的情况下解决了这个问题，阿基米德不能把金冠融化成规则形状以计算其[密度](../Page/密度.md "wikilink")。

在洗澡的时候，他注意到浴缸里的水面随着他浸入而上升，意识到可以用这种方法确定王冠的[体积](../Page/体积.md "wikilink")。
依常理，水不可被压缩，所以浸没的皇冠会排出等体积的水。将王冠重量除以排出水的体积相除，就可以确定王冠的密度。\[18\]
如果密度比金子低，则其一定加入了比金子更便宜且低密度的金属。激动地发现了这一方案后，阿基米德随后光着身子跑到街上，大声呼喊着“
[尤里卡](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/尤里卡_\(词语\) "wikilink")！” (,
*heúrēka*\!” 意为“我知道了！”）。\[19\] 测试成功，王冠中确实掺了银子。\[20\]

金冠的故事不见于已知的阿基米德的作品。并且，其中提到方法的实用性存疑，因为这需要极度准确地测量排水体积。the practicality of
the method it describes has been called into question, due to the
extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water
displacement.\[21\] Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that
applied the principle known in [流体静力学](../Page/流体静力学.md "wikilink") as
[阿基米德浮體原理](../Page/阿基米德浮體原理.md "wikilink"), which he describes in his
treatise *On Floating Bodies*. This principle states that a body
immersed in a fluid experiences a [浮力](../Page/浮力.md "wikilink") equal
to the weight of the fluid it displaces.\[22\] Using this principle, it
would have been possible to compare the density of the crown to that of
pure gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a pure gold reference
sample of the same weight, then immersing the apparatus in water. The
difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to
tip accordingly. [伽利略·伽利莱](../Page/伽利略·伽利莱.md "wikilink") considered it
"probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since,
besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by
Archimedes himself."\[23\] In a 12th-century text titled *Mappae
clavicula* there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the
water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used, and thus
solve the problem.\[24\]\[25\] The Latin poem *Carmen de ponderibus et
mensuris* of the 4th or 5th century describes the use of a hydrostatic
balance to solve the problem of the crown, and attributes the method to
Archimedes.\[26\]

--\>[阿基米德式螺旋抽水机](../Page/阿基米德式螺旋抽水机.md "wikilink") can raise water
efficiently.\]\] A large part of Archimedes' work in engineering arose
from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse.
阿基米德在工程上的造诣主要来自于满足其家乡的需求。The Greek
writer [阿特納奧斯](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/阿特納奧斯 "wikilink") described
how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the **,
which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval
warship. The *Syracusia* is said to have been the largest ship built in
classical antiquity.\[27\] According to Athenaeus, it was capable of
carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a [体育馆
(古希腊)](../Page/体育馆_\(古希腊\).md "wikilink") and a temple dedicated
to the goddess [阿佛洛狄忒](../Page/阿佛洛狄忒.md "wikilink") among its
facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount
of water through the hull, the
[阿基米德式螺旋抽水机](../Page/阿基米德式螺旋抽水机.md "wikilink")
was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water.
Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade
inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to
transfer water from a  body of water into irrigation canals. The
Archimedes' screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and
granulated solids such as coal and grain. The Archimedes' screw
described in Roman times by [维特鲁威](../Page/维特鲁威.md "wikilink") may have
been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the
[空中花园](../Page/空中花园.md "wikilink").\[28\]\[29\]\[30\] The
world's first seagoing
[蒸汽船](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/蒸汽船 "wikilink") with a
[螺旋槳](../Page/螺旋槳.md "wikilink") was the , which was launched in 1839
and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw.\[31\]

### 阿基米德之爪

，据阿基米德所述是用于防御Syracuse城的武器。也有人称作“船摇（the ship shaker）” the claw consisted
of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was
suspended. When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm
would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly
sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility
of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled *Superweapons
of the Ancient World* built a version of the claw and concluded that it
was a workable device.\[32\]\[33\]

The 2nd century AD 公元2世纪作家 [琉善](../Page/琉善.md "wikilink") wrote that
during the  (*c.* 214–212 BC), 阿基米德用火摧毁了敌人的战船。几个世纪以后，
[特拉勒斯的安提莫斯](../Page/特拉勒斯的安提莫斯.md "wikilink") mentions
es as Archimedes' weapon.\[34\] 此设备有时也被叫做“阿基米德热射线”The device, sometimes
called the "Archimedes heat ray",
用于把阳光集中于前来的战船上，使其着火。现代亦有人建造类似设备，并称作或者是。\[35\]

This purported weapon has been the subject of ongoing debate about its
credibility since the Renaissance.
[勒内·笛卡尔](../Page/勒内·笛卡尔.md "wikilink") rejected it
as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect
using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes.\[36\]
It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished
[青铜](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/青铜 "wikilink") or
[铜](../Page/铜.md "wikilink") shields acting as mirrors could have
been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship.

A test of the Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek
scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the  naval base
outside [雅典](../Page/雅典.md "wikilink"). On this occasion 70 mirrors were
used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet
(1.5 by 1 m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood  of a Roman warship
at a distance of around 160 feet (50 m). When the mirrors were focused
accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood
ship had a coating of [柏油](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/柏油 "wikilink")
paint, which may have aided combustion.\[37\] A coating of tar would
have been commonplace on ships in the classical era.

In October 2005 a group of students from the
[麻省理工学院](../Page/麻省理工学院.md "wikilink") carried
out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30 cm) square mirror tiles, focused
on a  wooden ship at a range of around 100 feet (30 m). Flames broke out
on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and
the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was
concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions.
The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show
*[流言終結者](../Page/流言終結者.md "wikilink")*, using a wooden fishing
boat in [旧金山](../Page/旧金山.md "wikilink") as the target. Again some
charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch
fire, wood needs to reach its [自燃温度](../Page/自燃温度.md "wikilink"), which
is around 300 °C (570 °F).\[38\]\[39\]

When *MythBusters* broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment
in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of "busted" (or
failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions
required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since
Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had
to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the
mirrors. *MythBusters* also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such
as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier
way of setting a ship on fire at short distances.\[40\]

In December 2010, *MythBusters* again looked at the heat ray story in a
special edition entitled "President's Challenge". Several experiments
were carried out, including a large scale test with 500 schoolchildren
aiming mirrors at a  of a Roman sailing ship 400 feet (120 m) away. In
all of the experiments, the sail failed to reach the 210 °C (410 °F)
required to catch fire, and the verdict was again "busted". The show
concluded that a more likely effect of the mirrors would have been
blinding, [眩光](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/眩光 "wikilink"), or
distracting the crew of the ship.\[41\]

### 其他发明发现

While Archimedes did not invent the [杠杆](../Page/杠杆.md "wikilink"), he
gave an explanation of the principle involved in his work *On the
Equilibrium of Planes*. Earlier descriptions of the lever are found in
the [逍遙學派](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/逍遙學派 "wikilink") of the
followers of [亚里士多德](../Page/亚里士多德.md "wikilink"), and are sometimes
attributed to [阿尔库塔斯](../Page/阿尔库塔斯.md "wikilink").\[42\]\[43\]
According to [帕普斯](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/帕普斯 "wikilink"),
Archimedes' work on levers caused him to remark: "Give me a place to
stand on, and I will move the Earth." ()\[44\] Plutarch describes how
Archimedes designed  [滑轮](../Page/滑轮.md "wikilink") systems, allowing
sailors to use the principle of [杠杆age](../Page/杠杆.md "wikilink") to
lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move.\[45\]
Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy
of the [投石機](../Page/投石機.md "wikilink"), and with inventing the
[里程錶](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/里程錶 "wikilink") during the
[第一次布匿战争](../Page/第一次布匿战争.md "wikilink"). The odometer was
described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a
container after each mile traveled.\[46\]

[西塞罗](../Page/西塞罗.md "wikilink") (106–43 BC) mentions Archimedes briefly
in his [对话](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/对话 "wikilink") **, which
portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129 BC. After the
capture of Syracuse *c.* 212 BC, General
[马克卢斯](../Page/马克卢斯.md "wikilink") is said to have taken
back to Rome two mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids
in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets.
Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by
[泰勒斯](../Page/泰勒斯.md "wikilink") and
[欧多克索斯](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/欧多克索斯 "wikilink"). The
dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only
personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of
Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to
Cicero, by [盖厄斯·撒尔庇西斯·凯勒斯](../Page/盖厄斯·撒尔庇西斯·凯勒斯.md "wikilink") to , who
described it thus:

This is a description of a [天象儀](../Page/天象儀.md "wikilink") or
[太阳系仪](../Page/太阳系仪.md "wikilink").
[帕普斯](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/帕普斯 "wikilink") stated that
Archimedes had written a manuscript (now lost) on the construction of
these mechanisms entitled . Modern research in this area has been
focused on the [安提基特拉机械](../Page/安提基特拉机械.md "wikilink"), another device
built  BC that was probably designed for the same purpose.\[47\]
Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated
knowledge of [差速器](../Page/差速器.md "wikilink").\[48\] This was once
thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in
ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism in 1902
has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient
Greeks.\[49\]\[50\]

often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made
contributions to the field of mathematics.
[普魯塔克](../Page/普魯塔克.md "wikilink") wrote: "He placed his
whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can
be no reference to the vulgar needs of life."\[51\] Archimedes was able
to use [無窮小量s](../Page/無窮小量.md "wikilink") in a way that is similar to
modern [积分](../Page/积分.md "wikilink"). Through proof by contradiction (
[歸謬法](../Page/歸謬法.md "wikilink")), he could give answers to problems to
an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within
which the answer lay. This technique is known as the
[穷竭法](../Page/穷竭法.md "wikilink"), and he employed it to
approximate the value of π. In ** he did this by drawing a larger
[六边形](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/六边形 "wikilink") outside a
[圆](../Page/圆.md "wikilink") and a smaller regular hexagon inside the
circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular
polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step.
As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate
approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had
96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of π lay between
3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with
its actual value of approximately 3.1416.\[52\] He also proved that the
[面积](../Page/面积.md "wikilink") of a circle was equal to π multiplied by
the [正方形](../Page/正方形.md "wikilink") of the
[半径](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/半径 "wikilink") of the circle
(πr<sup>2</sup>). In **, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when
added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is
the [阿基米德公理](../Page/阿基米德公理.md "wikilink") of real numbers.\[53\]

(approximately 1.7320261) and  (approximately 1.7320512). The actual
value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate.
He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had
obtained it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused
[約翰·沃利斯](../Page/約翰·沃利斯.md "wikilink") to remark that he was:
"as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his
investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of
inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his
results."\[54\] It is possible that he used an
[迭代](../Page/迭代.md "wikilink") procedure to calculate these
values.\[55\]

In **, Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a
[抛物线](../Page/抛物线.md "wikilink") and a straight line is
times the area of a corresponding inscribed
[三角形](../Page/三角形.md "wikilink") as shown in the figure at
right. He expressed the solution to the problem as an
[级数](../Page/级数.md "wikilink")
[等比数列](../Page/等比数列.md "wikilink") with the [common
ratio](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series "wikilink") :

\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty 4^{-n} = 1 + 4^{-1} + 4^{-2} + 4^{-3} + \cdots = {4\over 3}. \;\]

If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the
second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two
smaller [割线s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/割线 "wikilink"), and so on.
This proof uses a variation of the series  which sums to .

In **, Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that
the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that
the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote:
"There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of
[希伦二世](../Page/希伦二世.md "wikilink")), who think that the
number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not
only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also
that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited."
To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on
the [萬](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/萬 "wikilink"). The word is from
the Greek  *murias*, for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system
using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million) and concluded that the
number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8
[大数名词](../Page/大数名词.md "wikilink"), or 8.\[56\]

## 写作

The works of Archimedes were written in , the dialect of ancient
[锡拉库扎](../Page/锡拉库扎.md "wikilink").\[57\] The written work of
Archimedes has not survived as well as that of
[欧几里得](../Page/欧几里得.md "wikilink"), and seven of his
treatises are known to have existed only through references made to them
by other authors. [帕普斯](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/帕普斯 "wikilink")
mentions *[On
Sphere-Making](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Sphere-Making "wikilink")*
and another work on [多面体](../Page/多面体.md "wikilink"), while  quotes a
remark about [折射](../Page/折射.md "wikilink") from the  *Catoptrica*.
During his lifetime, Archimedes made his work known through
correspondence with the mathematicians in
[亚历山大港](../Page/亚历山大港.md "wikilink"). The writings
of Archimedes were first collected by the
[拜占庭帝国](../Page/拜占庭帝国.md "wikilink") Greek architect
[米利都的伊西多爾](../Page/米利都的伊西多爾.md "wikilink") (*c*. 530 AD), while
commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by  in the sixth century
AD helped to bring his work a wider audience. Archimedes' work was
translated into Arabic by  (836–901 AD), and Latin by  (*c.*
1114–1187 AD). During the [文艺复兴](../Page/文艺复兴.md "wikilink"), the
*Editio Princeps* (First Edition) was published in
[巴塞尔](../Page/巴塞尔.md "wikilink") in 1544 by Johann Herwagen
with the works of Archimedes in Greek and Latin.\[58\] Around the year
1586 [伽利略·伽利莱](../Page/伽利略·伽利莱.md "wikilink") invented a hydrostatic
balance for weighing metals in air and water after apparently being
inspired by the work of Archimedes.\[59\]

    In the first part of this treatise, Archimedes spells out the law of
    [equilibrium](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:equilibrium "wikilink")
    of fluids, and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around
    a center of gravity. This may have been an attempt at explaining the
    theory of contemporary Greek astronomers such as
    [埃拉托斯特尼](../Page/埃拉托斯特尼.md "wikilink") that the
    Earth is round. The fluids described by Archimedes are not , since
    he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in
    order to derive the spherical shape.

    In the second part, he calculates the equilibrium positions of
    sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the
    shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base

    in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many
    ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Dr.
    Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152
    ways.\[61\] The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that
    are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded.\[62\]
    The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in

    for throat or gullet, stomachos ().\[63\]

    In this treatise, Archimedes counts the number of grains of sand
    that will fit inside the universe. This book mentions the
    [日心说](../Page/日心说.md "wikilink") theory of the
    [太阳系](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/太阳系 "wikilink") proposed
    by [阿里斯塔克斯](../Page/阿里斯塔克斯.md "wikilink"), as well as contemporary
    ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various
    celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of
    the [萬](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/萬 "wikilink"), Archimedes
    concludes that the number of grains of sand required to fill the
    universe is 8 in modern notation. The introductory letter states
    that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. *The Sand
    Reckoner* or *Psammites* is the only surviving work in which
    Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.\[67\]

    In this work Archimedes uses , and shows how breaking up a figure
    into an infinite number of infinitely small parts can be used to
    determine its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this
    method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the
    [穷竭法](../Page/穷竭法.md "wikilink") to derive the results.
    As with *The Cattle Problem*, *The Method of Mechanical Theorems*

### 疑作

Archimedes' ** or *Liber Assumptorum* is a treatise with fifteen
propositions on the nature of circles. The earliest known copy of the
text is in [阿拉伯语](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/阿拉伯语 "wikilink"). The
scholars  and  argued that it cannot have been written by Archimedes in
its current form, since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by
another author. The *Lemmas* may be based on an earlier work by
Archimedes that is now lost.\[68\]

It has also been claimed that [海伦公式](../Page/海伦公式.md "wikilink") for
calculating the area of a triangle from the length of its sides was
known to Archimedes. However, the first reliable reference to the
formula is given by [亚历山大港的希罗](../Page/亚历山大港的希罗.md "wikilink") in the
1st century AD.\[69\]

## 阿基米德手记

[Archimedes_Palimpsest.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Archimedes_Palimpsest.jpg "fig:Archimedes_Palimpsest.jpg")
The foremost document containing the work of Archimedes is the . In
1906, the Danish professor  visited [君士坦丁堡](../Page/君士坦丁堡.md "wikilink")
and examined a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers written in the
13th century AD. He discovered that it was a , a document with text that
had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by
scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a
common practice in the Middle Ages as  was expensive. The older works in
the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of
previously unknown treatises by Archimedes.\[70\] The parchment spent
hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being
sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On October 29, 1998 it was
sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for $2 million at
[佳士得](../Page/佳士得.md "wikilink") in
[纽约](../Page/纽约.md "wikilink").\[71\] The palimpsest holds seven
treatises, including the only surviving copy of *On Floating Bodies* in
the original Greek. It is the only known source of *The Method of
Mechanical Theorems*, referred to by
[苏达辞书](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/苏达辞书 "wikilink") and
thought to have been lost forever. *Stomachion* was also discovered in
the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had
been found in previous texts. The palimpsest is now stored at the  in
[巴爾的摩](../Page/巴爾的摩.md "wikilink"),
[马里兰州](../Page/马里兰州.md "wikilink"), where it has been
subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of

that the familiar area formula for a triangle in terms of its three
sides, usually known as Heron's formula — *k* = , where *s* is the

阿奎納多的家是一棟超過 in floor area designed by Aguinaldo himself.\[1\] The house
features secret passages and hiding places for documents and weapons and
is filled with antique furniture and decorated throughout with motifs of
the Philippine flag and other national symbols. The building is divided
into three sections: the main house on the west side of the building,
the family wing on the east, and the tower located in between.\[2\] The
middle section is a five-story tower with a  at the very top. The
[mezzanine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/夹层 "wikilink") level on the
second floor is sometimes counted as an extra floor. The ground floor of
the house was previously unwalled which is typical of the houses during
the era.\[3\] Today, it houses a museum of Aguinaldo's memorabilia and
other historical artifacts. A [hologram](../Page/全息摄影.md "wikilink")
depicting Aguinaldo during the eve of June 12, 1898, is one of the
exhibits.\[4\]

Located on the second floor is the grand hall, a large meeting room with
the historic front window from where the Declaration of Independence was
read. The front Independence balcony was added by Aguinaldo during the
1919 renovations.\[5\] The dining room located on the same floor is
highlighted by a  of the Philippines on its ceiling. Also on this level
is the bedroom of Aguinaldo, the kitchen, a conference room, and a
partially covered terrace on the western end of the building. On the
east wing are three bedrooms for the general's three daughter's. A
covered balcony *(azotea)* at the end of the wing was christened by
Aguinaldo as *Galeria de los Pecadores* (Hall of the Sinners) as
military plots against the Spanish authorities were planned
there.\[6\]\[7\]\[8\]

The next level is a
[mezzanine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/夹层 "wikilink") library
which overlooks the grand hall below. A plight of stairs takes the
visitor to the Ambassador Room used as a study by the general's
son-in-law, [Ambassador](../Page/特命全權大使.md "wikilink") Jose Melencio.
The next floor is the other bedroom of Aguinaldo which he used during
the latter part of his life. A tiled  on this level gives a commanding
view of the town to as far as [Manila](../Page/马尼拉.md "wikilink"). A
very narrow ladder takes one to the top of the tower which is allegedly
the favorite spot of Aguinaldo.

The grounds of the house is lush with greenery bordered by a river on
the east and backed by a [fish
pond](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/鱼塭 "wikilink") to the south. On
display outside the house is Aguinaldo's personal car, a 1924
[Packard](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/帕卡德 "wikilink")
[limousine](../Page/加长轿车.md "wikilink") restored in November 2009.\[9\]

In the middle of the garden behind the house is a marble tomb where the
first president is interred.\[10\]

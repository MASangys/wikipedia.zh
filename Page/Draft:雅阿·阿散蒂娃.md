**雅阿·阿散蒂娃**（**Yaa Asantewaa，** 12月17, 1840 – October 17, 1921）
在阿散蒂帝國的Ejisu的王后母親 - 現在是現代加納的一部分, 由她的兄弟Nana Akwasi Afrane
Opese任命, the Edwesuhene, 或統治者,

Edwesu。 1900年，她領導了Ashanti戰爭，稱為金戰爭之戰,也被稱為Yaa Asantewaa戰爭，反對英國殖民主義.\[1\]

## Early years

Born in  1840 in , in southern Ghana, Yaa Asantewaa was the older of two
children. Her brother, Afrane Panin, became the chief of Edweso, a
nearby community. After a childhood without incident, she cultivated
crops on the land around . She entered a [polygamous
marriage](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/多配偶制 "wikilink") with a man from
Kumasi, with whom she had a daughter.\[2\]

## Prelude to rebellion

在她的兄弟統治期間，Yaa Asantewaa看到Ashanti聯邦經歷了一系列威脅其未來的事件, 包括1883年至1888年的內戰.
當她的哥哥於1894年去世, Yaa Asantewaa利用她作為王太后的權利提名她自己的孫子作為Ejisuhene.
當英國人於1896年將他驅逐到塞舌爾時, 與Asante Prempeh I國王和Asante政府的其他成員一起, Yaa
Asantewaa成為Ejisu-Juaben區的攝政王.在PrempehI被驅逐出境後, 英國黃金海岸總督弗雷德里克霍奇森,要求金凳子,
the symbol of the Asante nation.\[3\] This request led to a secret
meeting of the remaining members of the Asante government at
[Kumasi](../Page/库马西.md "wikilink"), to discuss how to secure the return
of their king. There was a disagreement among those present on how to go
about this. Yaa Asantewaa, who was present at this meeting, stood and
addressed the members of the council with these now-famous words:\[4\]

Yaa Asantewaa was chosen by a number of regional Asante kings to be the
war-leader of the Asante fighting force. This is the first and only
example for a woman to be given that role in Asante history.\[5\] The
Ashanti-British "War of the Golden Stool" was led by Queen Mother Nana
Yaa Asantewaa with an army of 5,000. \[6\]

## The rebellion and its aftermath

[Yaa_Asantewaa's_Cell.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yaa_Asantewaa's_Cell.jpg "fig:Yaa_Asantewaa's_Cell.jpg")
Beginning in March 1900, the rebellion laid siege to the fort at Kumasi
where the British had sought refuge. The fort still stands today as the
Kumasi Fort and Military Museum. After several months, the Gold Coast
governor eventually sent a force of 1,400 to quell the rebellion. During
the fighting, Queen Yaa Asantewaa and fifteen of her closest advisers
were captured, and they, too, were sent into exile to the
Seychelles.\[7\] The rebellion represented the final war in the
[Anglo-Asante](../Page/英国-阿散蒂战争.md "wikilink") series of wars that
lasted throughout the 19thcentury. On January 1, 1902 the British fully
seized the land that the Asante army had been defending from them for
almost a century, and the Asante empire was made a
[protectorate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/保护国 "wikilink") of the
British crown.\[8\]

Yaa Asantewaa died in exile in the Seychelles on October 17, 1921. Three
years after her death, on December 27, 1924, PrempehI and the other
remaining members of the exiled Asante court were allowed to return to
Asante. PrempehI made sure that the remains of Yaa Asantewaa and the
other exiled Asantes were returned for a proper royal burial.\[9\] Yaa
Asantewaa's dream for an Asante free of British rule was realized on
March 6, 1957, when the Asante protectorate gained independence as part
of Ghana. Ghana was the first African nation in [Sub-Saharan
Africa](../Page/撒哈拉以南非洲.md "wikilink") to achieve this feat.\[10\]

## Social roles of Asante women

Asantewaa understood the ramifications of British occupation. She is
seen by Ghanaians today as a queen mother who exercised her political
and social clout to help defend her kingdom. The role she played in
influencing the Ashanti men to battle the British appears to be a
function of her [matriarchal](../Page/母權.md "wikilink") status.
\[11\]The experience of seeing a woman serving as political and military
head of an empire was foreign to British colonial troops in 19th-century
Africa. Yaa Asantewaa's call upon the women of the Asante Empire is
based on the political obligations of Akan women and their respective
roles in legislative and judicial processes. The hierarchy of male
stools among the Akan people was complemented by female counterparts.
Within the village, elders who were heads of the matrilineages
(*mpanyimfo*), constituted the village council known as the *ôdekuro*.
The women, known as the *mpanyinfo*, and referred to as *aberewa* or
*ôbaa panyin*, were responsible for looking after women's affairs. For
every *ôdekuro*, an *ôbaa panyin* acted as the responsible party for the
affairs of the women of the village and served as a member of the
village council.\[12\]

The head of a division, the *ôhene*, and the head of the autonomous
political community, the *ômanhene*, had their female counterparts known
as the *ôhemaa*: a female ruler who sat on their councils. The *ôhemaa*
and *ôhene* were all of the same *mogya*, blood or localized
matrilineage. The occupant of the female stool in Kumasi state, the
*Asantehemaa*, the united Asante, since her male counterpart was
ex-officio of the Asanthene, was a member of the Kôtôkô Council, the
Executive Committee or Cabinet of the Asanteman *Nhyiamu*, General
Assembly of Asante rulers. Female stool occupants participated not only
in the judicial and legislative processes, but also in the making and
unmaking of war, and the distribution of land.\[13\]

## Place in history and cultural legacy

Yaa Asantewaa remains a much-loved figure in Asante history and the
history of Ghana as a whole for her role in confronting the colonialism
of the British. She is immortalized in song as follows:

To highlight the importance of encouraging more female leaders in
Ghanaian society, the  was established at Kumasi in 1960 with funds from
the [Ghana Education
Trust](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_Education_Trust "wikilink").\[14\]

In the year 2000, a week-long centenary celebration was held in Ghana to
acknowledge Yaa Asantewaa's accomplishments. As part of these
celebrations, a  was dedicated to her at  in the Ejisu–Juaben District
on 3August 2000. Unfortunately, a fire on 23July 2004 destroyed several
historical items, including her sandals and battle dress
(*batakarikese*) seen in the photograph above.\[15\] The current
Queen-mother of Ejisu is Yaa AsantewaaII. A second Yaa Asantewaa
festival was held 1–5August 2006 in Ejisu.\[16\]

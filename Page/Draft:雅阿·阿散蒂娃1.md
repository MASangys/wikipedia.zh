(October 17, 1840 – October 17, 1921) the  of [Ejisu](../Page/埃吉蘇-朱阿本自治市政區.md "wikilink") in the [Ashanti Empire](../Page/阿散蒂王国.md "wikilink")now part of modern-day [Ghana](../Page/加纳.md "wikilink"), appointed by her brother Nana Akwasi Afrane Opese, the Edwesuhene, or ruler, of Edwesu. In 1900 she led the Ashanti war known as the , also known as the Yaa Asantewaa war, against [British colonialism](../Page/大英帝国.md "wikilink").\[1\]

## Early years

Yaa Asantewaa出生於1840年，位於加納南部的Besease，是兩個孩子中較大的一個。她的兄弟Afrane Panin成為附近社區Edweso的負責人。在沒有事故的童年後，她在Boankra周圍的土地上種植莊稼。她和一個來自庫馬西的男人進行了一夫多妻的婚姻，並與她生了一個女兒。

## Prelude to rebellion

During her brother's reign, Yaa Asantewaa saw the [Ashanti](../Page/阿散蒂地區.md "wikilink") Confederacy go through a series of events that threatened its future, including civil war from 1883 to 1888. When her brother died in 1894, Yaa Asantewaa used her right as Queen Mother to nominate her own grandson as Ejisuhene. When the British exiled him to the [Seychelles](../Page/塞舌尔.md "wikilink") in 1896, along with the   and other members of the Asante government, Yaa Asantewaa became regent of the Ejisu–Juaben district. After the deportation of PrempehI, the [British](../Page/大不列颠及爱尔兰联合王国.md "wikilink") governor-general of the [Gold Coast](../Page/英屬黃金海岸.md "wikilink"), , demanded the [Golden Stool](../Page/金凳子.md "wikilink"), the symbol of the Asante nation.\[2\] This request led to a secret meeting of the remaining members of the Asante government at [Kumasi](../Page/库马西.md "wikilink"), to discuss how to secure the return of their king. There was a disagreement among those present on how to go about this. Yaa Asantewaa, who was present at this meeting, stood and addressed the members of the council with these now-famous words:\[3\]

Yaa Asantewaa was chosen by a number of regional Asante kings to be the war-leader of the Asante fighting force. This is the first and only example for a woman to be given that role in Asante history.\[4\] The Ashanti-British "War of the Golden Stool" was led by Queen Mother Nana Yaa Asantewaa with an army of 5,000. \[5\]

## The rebellion and its aftermath

[Yaa_Asantewaa's_Cell.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yaa_Asantewaa's_Cell.jpg "fig:Yaa_Asantewaa's_Cell.jpg") 起始於1900年3月 the rebellion laid siege to the fort at Kumasi where the British had sought refuge. The fort still stands today as the Kumasi Fort and Military Museum. After several months, the Gold Coast governor eventually sent a force of 1,400 to quell the rebellion. During the fighting, Queen Yaa Asantewaa and fifteen of her closest advisers were captured, and they, too, were sent into exile to the Seychelles.\[6\] The rebellion represented the final war in the [Anglo-Asante](../Page/英国-阿散蒂战争.md "wikilink") series of wars that lasted throughout the 19thcentury. On January 1, 1902 the British fully seized the land that the Asante army had been defending from them for almost a century, and the Asante empire was made a [protectorate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/保护国 "wikilink") of the British crown.\[7\]

Yaa Asantewaa died in exile in the Seychelles on October 17, 1921. Three years after her death, on December 27, 1924, PrempehI and the other remaining members of the exiled Asante court were allowed to return to Asante. PrempehI made sure that the remains of Yaa Asantewaa and the other exiled Asantes were returned for a proper royal burial.\[8\] Yaa Asantewaa's dream for an Asante free of British rule was realized on March 6, 1957, when the Asante protectorate gained independence as part of Ghana. Ghana was the first African nation in [Sub-Saharan Africa](../Page/撒哈拉以南非洲.md "wikilink") to achieve this feat.\[9\]

## Social roles of Asante women

Asantewaa understood the ramifications of British occupation. She is seen by Ghanaians today as a queen mother who exercised her political and social clout to help defend her kingdom. The role she played in influencing the Ashanti men to battle the British appears to be a function of her [matriarchal](../Page/母權.md "wikilink") status. \[10\]The experience of seeing a woman serving as political and military head of an empire was foreign to British colonial troops in 19th-century Africa. Yaa Asantewaa's call upon the women of the Asante Empire is based on the political obligations of Akan women and their respective roles in legislative and judicial processes. The hierarchy of male stools among the Akan people was complemented by female counterparts. Within the village, elders who were heads of the matrilineages (*mpanyimfo*), constituted the village council known as the *ôdekuro*. The women, known as the *mpanyinfo*, and referred to as *aberewa* or *ôbaa panyin*, were responsible for looking after women's affairs. For every *ôdekuro*, an *ôbaa panyin* acted as the responsible party for the affairs of the women of the village and served as a member of the village council.\[11\]

The head of a division, the *ôhene*, and the head of the autonomous political community, the *ômanhene*, had their female counterparts known as the *ôhemaa*: a female ruler who sat on their councils. The *ôhemaa* and *ôhene* were all of the same *mogya*, blood or localized matrilineage. The occupant of the female stool in Kumasi state, the *Asantehemaa*, the united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex-officio of the Asanthene, was a member of the Kôtôkô Council, the Executive Committee or Cabinet of the Asanteman *Nhyiamu*, General Assembly of Asante rulers. Female stool occupants participated not only in the judicial and legislative processes, but also in the making and unmaking of war, and the distribution of land.\[12\]

## Place in history and cultural legacy

Yaa Asantewaa remains a much-loved figure in Asante history and the history of Ghana as a whole for her role in confronting the colonialism of the British. She is immortalized in song as follows:

To highlight the importance of encouraging more female leaders in Ghanaian society, the  was established at Kumasi in 1960 with funds from the [Ghana Education Trust](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_Education_Trust "wikilink").\[13\]

In the year 2000, a week-long centenary celebration was held in Ghana to acknowledge Yaa Asantewaa's accomplishments. As part of these celebrations, a  was dedicated to her at  in the Ejisu–Juaben District on 3August 2000. Unfortunately, a fire on 23July 2004 destroyed several historical items, including her sandals and battle dress (*batakarikese*) seen in the photograph above.\[14\] The current Queen-mother of Ejisu is Yaa AsantewaaII. A second Yaa Asantewaa festival was held 1–5August 2006 in Ejisu.\[15\]

A television documentary by Ivor Agyeman–Duah, entitled *Yaa AsantewaaThe Exile of King Prempeh and the Heroism of An African Queen*, premiered in Ghana in 2001.\[18\]

A stage show written by , *Yaa Asantewaa: Warrior Queen*, directed by  and featuring master drummer ,\[19\]\[20\] with a pan-African cast, toured the UK and Ghana in 2001–02.\[21\]\[22\] A radio drama by the same author was also serialized October 13-17, 2003.\[23\] on [BBC Radio Four](../Page/BBC廣播四台.md "wikilink")'s **.\[24\]\[25\]

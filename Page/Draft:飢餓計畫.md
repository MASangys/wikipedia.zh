**飢餓計劃**（德語：der Hungerplan; der
Backe-Plan）是納粹德國在二次世界大戰期間施行的一項計畫，計畫的主要內容為掠奪蘇聯的糧食並分發給士兵及平民；這也導致數百萬「血統低劣」的斯拉夫人喪命於巴巴羅薩行動中（此為1941年納粹德國對蘇聯的侵略事件）。飢餓計劃的產生是由於德國在糧食供應方面無法自給自足，納粹不惜一切代價來延續戰爭及維持國內士氣，以便從征討來的土地上取得糧食。

這是一場精心策畫的饑荒，以政治為出發點計畫並實施。該計劃是在德意志國防軍（德國武裝部隊）入侵行動的規劃階段制定的，旨在將烏克蘭食品從俄羅斯中部和北部轉移出去，並將其重新定向，以利於入侵的軍隊和德國人口。

The plan resulted in the deaths of millions of people.\[1\] The plan as
a means of [mass murder](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/屠杀 "wikilink")
was outlined in several documents, including one that became known as ,
which quoted a number of "20 to 30 million" expected Russian deaths from
"military actions and crises of food supply."

## 計畫綱要

飢餓計劃的設計者是赫伯特‧巴克。 巴克與海因里希‧希姆萊等人共同領導了一個納粹政治家聯盟，致力於確保德國的糧食供應。
1940年12月希特勒宣布有意入侵蘇聯時，飢餓計劃幾乎可能已經決定。當然，到1941年5月2日，它正處於計劃的後期階段，並準備好在所有納粹主要國家之間進行討論。各部委和經濟學的Oberkommando
der Wehrmacht（OKW）辦公室，由Georg
Thomas將軍領導。俄羅斯鐵路的能力不足，公路運輸不足以及燃料短缺，這意味著德國軍隊必須靠在他們在蘇聯西部地區征服的領土上生活來養活自己。
1941年5月2日，負責入侵蘇聯後勤規劃的常務秘書以及其他高級納粹黨官員，國家官員和軍官參加了會議，其結論如下：

The architect of the Hunger Plan was .\[2\] Together with others, such
as [Heinrich Himmler](../Page/海因里希·希姆莱.md "wikilink"), Backe led a
coalition of Nazi politicians, dedicated to securing Germany's food
supply. The Hunger Plan may have been decided on almost as soon as
[Hitler](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/阿道夫·希特勒 "wikilink") announced his
intention to invade the Soviet Union in December 1940. Certainly by 2
May 1941, it was in the advanced stages of planning and was ready for
discussion between all the major Nazi state ministries and the
[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht](../Page/國防軍最高統帥部_\(德國\).md "wikilink")
(OKW) office of economics, headed by General .\[3\] The lack of capacity
of the , the inadequacy of road transport and the shortages of fuel,
meant that the German Army would have to feed itself by living off the
land in the territories they conquered in the western regions of the
Soviet Union.\[4\] A meeting on 2 May 1941 between the permanent
secretaries responsible for logistical planning for the invasion of the
Soviet Union, as well as other high-ranking [Nazi
party](../Page/纳粹党.md "wikilink") functionaries, state officials
and military officers, included in its conclusions:

The minutes of the meeting exemplify German planning for the occupation
of the Soviet Union. They present a deliberate decision on the life or
death of vast parts of the local population as a logical, inevitable
development.\[5\] Three weeks later, on 23 May 1941, economic policy
guidelines for the coming invasion appeared that had been produced by 's
agricultural section of the Economic Staff East, which had direct
responsibility for the economic and agricultural exploitation of the
soon-to-be occupied Soviet territories:

The perceived grain surpluses of [Ukraine](../Page/乌克兰.md "wikilink")
figured particularly prominently in the vision of a "self-sufficient"
Germany. Hitler himself had stated in August 1939 that Germany needed
"the Ukraine, in order that no one is able to starve us again as in the
."\[6\] Yet Ukraine did not produce enough grain for export to solve
Germany's problems.\[7\] Scooping off the
[agricultural](../Page/农业.md "wikilink") surplus in Ukraine for the
purpose of feeding the Reich called for:

1.  the annihilation of what the German régime perceived as a
    superfluous population (Jews, the population of Ukrainian large
    cities such as [Kiev](../Page/基輔.md "wikilink") which did not
    receive any supplies at all)\[8\]
2.  the extreme reduction of the rations allocated to Ukrainians in the
    remaining cities
3.  a reduction in the foodstuffs consumed by the farming
    population\[9\]

In the discussion of the plan, Backe noted a "surplus population" in
Russia of about 20 to 30 million. If that population was cut off from
food, that food could be used to feed both the invading German Army and
the German population itself.
[Industrialization](../Page/工業化.md "wikilink") had created a large
urban society in the Soviet Union. The Backe plan envisioned that this
population, numbering many millions, would be cut off from their food
supply, thus freeing up the food produced in the Soviet Union, now at
Germany's disposal, to sustain Germans. As a result, great suffering
among the native Soviet population was envisaged, with tens of millions
of deaths expected within the first year of the German occupation.
[Starvation](../Page/餓死.md "wikilink") was to be an integral part of the
German Army's campaign. Planning for starvation preceded the invasion
and became in fact an essential condition of it; the German planners
believed that the assault on the Soviet Union could not succeed without
it.\[10\] According to Gesine Gerhard, German agricultural officials saw
the Hunger Plan as a solution to both the European food crisis and a
method for exterminating the "undesirable" Soviet population.\[11\]

## 計畫影響

The Hunger Plan caused the deaths of millions of citizens in the
German-occupied territories of the Soviet Union. The historian
estimates that "4.2 million Soviet citizens (largely Russians,
Belarusians, and Ukrainians) \[were\] starved by the German occupiers in
1941–1944."\[12\] Among the victims were many Jews, whom the Nazis had
forced into ghettos, and Soviet [prisoners of
war](../Page/战俘.md "wikilink"), whose movement was most easily
controlled by the Germans and thus easily cut off from food
supplies.\[13\] Jews, for example, were prohibited from purchasing eggs,
butter, milk, meat or fruit.\[14\] The so-called "rations" for Jews in
Minsk and other cities within the control of [Army Group
Centre](../Page/中央集團軍.md "wikilink") were no more than  per day. Tens of
thousands of Jews died of hunger and hunger-related causes over the
winter of 1941–1942.\[15\]
[Bundesarchiv_Bild_192-208,_KZ_Mauthausen,_Sowjetische_Kriegsgefangene.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_192-208,_KZ_Mauthausen,_Sowjetische_Kriegsgefangene.jpg "fig:Bundesarchiv_Bild_192-208,_KZ_Mauthausen,_Sowjetische_Kriegsgefangene.jpg").
Unknown date\]\] The most reliable figures for the death rate among
Soviet prisoners of war in German captivity reveal that 3.3 million died
from a total of 5.7 million captured between June 1941 and February
1945, most directly or indirectly as a result of starvation and
undernourishment.\[16\] Of these 3.3 million, 2 million had already died
by the beginning of February 1942.\[17\] The enormous number of deaths
was the result of a deliberate policy of starvation directed against
Soviet POWs. The German planning staffs had reckoned on capturing and
thus having to feed up to two million prisoners within the first eight
weeks of the war, i.e. roughly the same number as during the [1940
campaign](../Page/法國戰役.md "wikilink") against France and the Low
Countries.\[18\] The number of French, Belgian and Dutch POWs who died
in German captivity, however, was extremely low compared with the number
of deaths among Soviet POWs.

In spite of the exorbitantly high death rate among Soviet POWs, who
constituted the main group of victims of the Hunger Plan, the plan was
never fully implemented due to the ultimate failure of the German
military campaign.\[19\] As the historian  makes clear, however, "what
one is dealing with here is the blueprint for a programme of mass murder
unprecedented in modern history".\[20\] Except in isolated cases, the
Germans lacked the manpower to enforce a 'food blockade' of the Soviet
cities; neither could they confiscate all the food for their own
purposes. However, the Germans were able to significantly supplement
their grain stocks, particularly from the granaries in fertile Ukraine,
and cut off the Soviets from them, leading to significant starvation in
the Soviet-held territories (most drastically in
[Leningrad](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/圣彼得堡 "wikilink"), encircled by
German forces, where [about one million people
died](../Page/列寧格勒圍城戰.md "wikilink")).\[21\] The lack of
food also contributed to the starvation of [forced
labourers](../Page/強迫勞動.md "wikilink") and  inmates in Germany.

## Starvation in other German-occupied territories

The Hunger Plan directed against the population of Soviet cities and
grain-deficit territories was unique - the Nazis formulated no other
premeditated plan against the inhabitants of any other German-occupied
territory. However, starvation did affect other parts of German-occupied
Europe, including Greece ([Great Famine](../Page/希臘大饑荒.md "wikilink"))
and Poland (the [General Government](../Page/波蘭總督府.md "wikilink")).
Unlike in the Soviet Union, in Poland  (especially in the [Warsaw
Ghetto](../Page/華沙猶太區.md "wikilink")) suffered most heavily, although
ethnic Poles also faced increasing levels of starvation.  estimated that
"in the whole of occupied Poland 500,000 to 600,000 Jews died in ghettos
and labor camps", in part due to starvation.\[22\] In early 1943, [Hans
Frank](../Page/漢斯·法郎克.md "wikilink"), the German governor of Poland,
estimated that three million Poles would face starvation as a result of
the Plan. In August, the Polish capital
[Warsaw](../Page/华沙.md "wikilink") was completely cut off from grain
deliveries. Only the above-average harvest of 1943 and the collapsing
Eastern Front of 1944 saved the Poles from starvation. Western Europe
was third on the German list for food re-prioritizing. Food was also
shipped to Germany from France and other occupied territories in the
West, although the West was never subjected to the genocidal starvation
experienced in the East. As many as 22,000 people died during the  as a
result of an embargo placed by the Germans on transporting food into the
country.

By mid-1941 the German minority in Poland received  per day, while Poles
received  and Jews in the ghetto .\[23\] The Jewish ration supplied a
mere 7.5 percent of human daily needs; Polish rations only 26 percent.
Only the rations allocated to Germans fulfilled the full needs of their
daily caloric intake.\[24\]

connects it to [Jerusalem](../Page/耶路撒冷.md "wikilink") and the [Tel Aviv
Metropolitan Area](../Page/特拉維夫都會區.md "wikilink"). The [international
community](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/国际社会 "wikilink") considers
Israeli settlements in the West Bank , but the Israeli government

## Etymology

The town name "Ma'ale Adumim" is taken from the  and :\[3\] ''The
boundary \[of the tribe of Judah\] ascended from the Valley of  to  and
turned north to
[Gilgal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/基比亞哈拉羅 "wikilink"),
facing the *Ascent of Adumim*, which is south of the wadi.'' Literally
"Ascent of Red", it takes its name from the red rock lining the ascent
from the [Dead Sea](../Page/死海.md "wikilink").\[4\]

## History

Ma'ale Adumim was originally a  outpost,\[5\] or Israeli labourers'
camp,\[6\] which was then, in 1977, designed to become a [planned
community](../Page/新市鎮.md "wikilink") and
[suburban](../Page/郊區.md "wikilink") [commuter
town](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/卧城 "wikilink") for nearby Jerusalem,
to which many residents would commute daily.\[7\] In the early 1970s,
Israel's [Labor](../Page/以色列工党.md "wikilink") government discussed a
plan to expand the boundaries of Jerusalem eastward by founding an
industrial zone and a workers' village on the Jericho road\[8\] on lands
which the displaced Bedouins of the  tribe had negotiated with
Palestinian landowners in the 1950s to use as pastures for their flocks
and a settled base for their families. \[9\] In the winter of 1975, on
the seventh night of [Hanukkah](../Page/光明节.md "wikilink"), a [Gush
Emunim](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/忠信社群 "wikilink") group of 23
families and six singles erected a prefabricated concrete structure and
two wooden huts at the site now known as "Founder's Circle" \[10\] The
group was evicted several times. In 1977, after [Menachem
Begin](../Page/梅纳赫姆·贝京.md "wikilink") took office, Ma'ale Adumim was
granted official status as a permanent settlement,\[11\] In the late
1990s, approximately 1,050 Palestinian Jahalin Bedouins were forced to
move from land that now forms part of the settlement.\[12\] Court orders
required compensation by the Israeli government and they received cash,
electricity and water supplies.\[13\] According to the residents, they
had to sell most of their livestock and their Bedouin way of life
ended.\[14\]

The chief urban planner was architect [Rachel
Walden](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Walden "wikilink"). In
March 1979, Maaleh Adumim achieved  status.\[15\] The urban plan for
Ma'ale Adumim, finalized in 1983, encompasses a total of , of which
have been built so far, in a bloc that includes Ma'ale Adumim, , , and
.\[16\]

The mayor of Ma'ale Adumim is [Benny
Kashriel](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Kashriel "wikilink"), who
was recently elected to a third term by a large majority.

## Geography

[Artificial_lake,_Ma'ale_Adumim.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Artificial_lake,_Ma'ale_Adumim.jpg "fig:Artificial_lake,_Ma'ale_Adumim.jpg")
The city is surrounded on four sides by the [Judean
Desert](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/犹大旷野 "wikilink")\[17\] and is
linked to Jerusalem and the [Tel Aviv Metropolitan
Area](../Page/特拉維夫都會區.md "wikilink") via Highway 1. Due to
its strategic location between the northern and southern parts of the
West Bank, Palestinians see this as a threat to the territorial
continuity of a future [Palestinian
state](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/巴勒斯坦 "wikilink"). This claim is
disputed by mayor Benny Kashriel, who claims that continuity would be
attained by circling Ma'ale Adumim to the east.\[18\] Israeli drivers
use a [bypass road](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/繞行道路 "wikilink") that
exits the city to the west, entering Jerusalem through the  Junction or
a tunnel that goes under [Mt. Scopus](../Page/斯科普斯山.md "wikilink").
These routes were built in the wake of the
[First](../Page/第一次巴勒斯坦大起義.md "wikilink") and
[Second Intifadas](../Page/阿克萨群众起义.md "wikilink") when Palestinian
militants shot at motorists and cars were stoned. The  passed through

## Land ownership

Ma'ale Adumim\]\]  initially claimed that 86.4% of Ma'ale Adumim was
privately owned Palestinian land, basing the figure on data leaked from
a government report.\[19\]\[20\] After Peace Now petitioned the Israeli
courts to have the official data released, the group revised the figure
to 0.5 percent of the settlement is built on private land. Israel claim
that Maale Adumin was built on what Israel defines as "state lands," or
areas not registered in anyone's name, and that no private property was
being seized for building.\[21\] Palestinians claim lands from the
villages of , , ,  and  were expropriated for building in Ma'aleh
Adumim.\[22\]

According to B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, "The
expropriation procedure used in Ma'ale Adummim is unprecedented in the
settlement enterprise. Expropriation of land for settlement purposes is
forbidden, not only under international law but also according to the
long-standing, official position of Israeli governments. Most
settlements were built on area that was declared state land or on land
that was requisitioned - ostensibly temporarily - for military purposes.
It appears that in Ma'ale Adummim, the government decided to permanently
expropriate the land because it viewed the area as an integral part of
Jerusalem that would forever remain under Israeli control."\[23\]

## Economy

## Education and culture

[MachanaimSinagoga_1.JPG](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MachanaimSinagoga_1.JPG "fig:MachanaimSinagoga_1.JPG")
In 2011, Ma'ale Adumim had 21 schools and 80 kindergartens.\[27\] A

## Legal issues

[Ma'ale_adumim_02.JPG](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ma'ale_adumim_02.JPG "fig:Ma'ale_adumim_02.JPG")
In 2005, a report by  for the  stated that the "three major settlement
blocs—[Gush Etzion](../Page/古什埃齐翁.md "wikilink"), Ma'ale Adumim and
[Ariel](../Page/阿里埃勒.md "wikilink")—will effectively divide Palestinian
territory into cantons or
[Bantustans](../Page/班图斯坦.md "wikilink")."\[31\] Israel says the
solution is a bypass road similar to those used daily by Israelis to
avoid driving through hostile Arab areas. The 2007 development project
in east Ma'ale Adumim was supported by [Ariel
Sharon](../Page/阿里埃勒·沙龙.md "wikilink") in 2005.\[32\]
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman  denied the 2007 extension plan is a
violation of the , under which Israel agreed to freeze all building in
the settlements.

In 2008, a project to link Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem, known as the
—short for "East 1", as it appears on old zoning maps—was criticized
by the [Palestinian Authority](../Page/巴勒斯坦民族权力机构.md "wikilink"), US
Secretary of State [Condoleezza Rice](../Page/康多莉扎·赖斯.md "wikilink") and
US President [George W. Bush](../Page/乔治·沃克·布什.md "wikilink").\[33\] As
a result, a plan for 3,500-5,000 homes in Mevaseret Adumim was
frozen.\[34\] The new Judea and Samaria District police headquarters,
formerly located in the  neighborhood of Jerusalem, was completed in May
2008.\[35\]

Ma'ale Adumim is widely regarded by the international community as
illegal under international law according to the Fourth Geneva
Convention (article 49), which prohibits an occupying power transferring
citizens from its own territory to occupied territory. Israel maintains
that international conventions relating to occupied land do not apply to
the West Bank because they were not under the legitimate sovereignty of
any state in the first place.\[36\] This view was rejected by the
[International Court of Justice](../Page/国际法院.md "wikilink") and the
[International Committee of the Red
Cross](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/红十字国际委员会 "wikilink").\[37\]

## Housing shortage

[Yma1.JPG](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yma1.JPG "fig:Yma1.JPG")
One of the purposes of establishing Ma'aleh Adumim was to supply
affordable housing for young couples who could not afford the high cost
of homes in Jerusalem. Although the municipal boundaries cover 48,000
dunams, the city has been suffering from an acute housing shortage since
2009 due to the freeze on new construction.  most of the real estate
market was in second-hand properties.\[38\]

## Archaeology

The Byzantine [monastery](../Page/僧院.md "wikilink") of , once the most
important monastic centre in the Judean Desert in the early Christian
era, is located in Ma'ale Adumim.\[39\] Other archeological sites on the
outskirts of Ma'ale Adumim include the Khan el-Hatruri,\[40\] also known
as the Inn of the Good Samaritan (cited in a parable by Jesus, in Luke
10:30–37),\[41\] and the remains of the built in the 5th century and
destroyed by the [Mamluk](../Page/马木留克.md "wikilink") sultan
[Baybars](../Page/拜巴尔一世.md "wikilink").\[42\]  is a 13th-century  for
pilgrims on the route between Jerusalem and
[Mecca](../Page/麥加.md "wikilink") via .\[43\]

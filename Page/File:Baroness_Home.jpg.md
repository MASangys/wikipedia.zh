The image here is claimed to be **fair use** as it is:

1.  A portrait of one of Britain's most famous persons;
2.  There are no copyleft alternatives of such a photo;
3.  The image used is of a ceremonial and not a commerical value;
4.  This is a low-resolution screenshot from a television documentary.
    This will not affect the sales of the documentary.
5.  The article is greatly improved by the prominence of this photo;
6.  Which is hosted and displayed on the not-for-profit Wikipedia
    Encylopedia for educational purposes.
7.  The person in the photo died in 1990.

## Summary

This image is a version of a photograph of one side (the front side) of
the 1947 [Nobel Prize Medal in
Physics](../Page/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics.md "wikilink") presented to Sir
[Edward Victor Appleton](../Page/Edward_Victor_Appleton.md "wikilink")
by the [Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences](../Page/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences.md "wikilink") on
display at the [University of
Edinburgh](../Page/University_of_Edinburgh.md "wikilink"). The Medal was
on display in Appleton Tower, [University of
Edinburgh](../Page/University_of_Edinburgh.md "wikilink"), where it was
photographed by [David
Monniaux](../Page/User:David.Monniaux.md "wikilink"), who uploaded his
digitized photograph to Wikipedia in 2005. It is a photograph of the
"front side" of the medal that Appleton received, not the "back side,"
which is specific to the medals for Physics and Chemistry.

Note that the Economics prize uses a different medal, see
[1](http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/medal.html).

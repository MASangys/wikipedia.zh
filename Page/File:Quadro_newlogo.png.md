## Licensing

## Fair Use Rationale

1\. This is the new logo for the [Quadro](../Page/Quadro.md "wikilink")
line of [GPUs](../Page/Graphics_processing_unit.md "wikilink") from
[NVIDIA](../Page/NVIDIA.md "wikilink").
2\. This logo is used by NVIDIA for people to identify its Quadro brand
worldwide. **It is used to identify the Quadro brand in general, and the
Quadro FX, Plex and NVS series of GPUs in particular.** Hence its usage
in the respective articles in Wikipedia stands justified and is used to
illustrate that the articles wherein it is used, mainly the articles on
[Quadro](../Page/Quadro.md "wikilink") are that of the products
mentioned.
3\. It must be noted that, while the full logo set is available for
ready download from NVIDIA's website, and that set contains the logo in
question here as well as many other logos depicting NVIDIA products at
significantly higher resolutions, the one used here is of fairly low
resolution, and dwarfs, when compared to the original high-res logo.
4\. The usage of the logo does not restrain the copyright holder NVIDIA
from the sale of its product anywhere in the world, nor does it strip
its rights over this particular product.
5\. The usage of the logo in
[Wikipedia](../Page/Wikipedia.md "wikilink") is purely trivial and is
informative in nature.
6\. It should also be noted that replacing this image with a free
content image is not worthwhile, as it would not amount to
identification of the product involved.

1.  There exists no free alternative, nor can one be created. Spock is a
    fictional character, all images of him are necessarily copyrighted.
2.  This image respects commercial opportunities - a cropped screenshot
    cannot meaningfully compete with a 44 minute episode.
3.  The image represents a minimal use - it is a cropped screenshot -
    less than a single frame from an episode that has over 50 000
    frames. It is of a reasonable low resolution.
4.  The image has been previously published, in the broadcasted, as well
    as sold on DVD Star Trek episode "The Way to Eden"
5.  The image is of a major character from a culturally significant
    series of television shows. It is encyclopedic.
6.  The image generally meets the image use policy.
7.  The image is used in at least one article,
    [Spock](../Page/Spock.md "wikilink").
8.  The image contributes strongly to the article. As a fictional
    character, the subject is more easily visualised.
9.  The image is used only in the article namespace.
10. The image is from <http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Spock>, the
    copyright is owned by [Paramount
    Pictures](../Page/派拉蒙电影公司.md "wikilink").

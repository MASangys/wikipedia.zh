## Fair use for [Doctor Who](../Page/Doctor_Who.md "wikilink") and [博士 (異世奇人)](../Page/博士_\(異世奇人\).md "wikilink")

This image, Versions of the Doctor.jpg, is being linked here; though the
images contained in the collage are copyright © to the BBC, it is
believed that they are covered by the U.S. fair use law because:

1.  The images in question are low-resolution copies of publicity
    photographs released between 1963 and 2009;
2.  The images are being used for informational purposes about the lead
    character ("[博士 (異世奇人)](../Page/博士_\(異世奇人\).md "wikilink")") from
    *Doctor Who*;
3.  The images are significant because they demonstrate the changing
    nature of the character in the programme's long history;
4.  The use of the images in these articles will have no effect on the
    BBC's commercial use of the images in question.

**Rationale for the fair use of this image in the articles [Death and
funeral of Leonid
Brezhnev](../Page/Death_and_funeral_of_Leonid_Brezhnev.md "wikilink"):**

  - The [Russian Government](../Page/Russian_Government.md "wikilink")
    has yet to release images from the Brezhnev Era into [public
    domain](../Page/public_domain.md "wikilink") (copyright expires
    after 50 years)
  - The image is used to show readers how Brezhnev looked like in a
    coffin, when dead
  - The image is being used in an informative way
  - The image is a small, web-resolution image
  - The image is used to illustrate the persion in which the article
    centres
  - The image's only purpose is to aid in the description of Brezhnev,
    and for no other purpose

    When one is announcing the following WILL that I have written, I would
    have rested heavenly in peace.

    HERE IS MY WILL :-

    ALL of the rest, residue, and reminder of my estate, both real and
    personal, of every kind and description, wherever situated and whether
    now owned or hereafter acquired, including any power of appointment,
    I give, devise, and bequeath to MR CHAN CHUN CHUEN (HKID:*******(*)),
    who was born in Hong Kong on 23rd December 1959.

    To my belief, MR CHAN CHUN CHUEN, will be capable of determining the
    distribution and use of my estate in a good and proper way.
    My will is established entirely and wholeheartedly for the need and
    good of my family and loved ones. It is my great appreciation that my
    will could be announced fairly and righteously as stated.

    I am deeply and thankfully convinced that my will is proudly guided
    with God help. I thank you all.

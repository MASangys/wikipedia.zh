## Summary

## Fair use and reason why this cannot be replaced by free media

### [Pat Morita](../Page/Pat_Morita.md "wikilink")

The subject of the photo is [Pat
Morita](../Page/Pat_Morita.md "wikilink"), a former Hollywood
personality. He passed away in 2005. Due to his death it is practically
impossible to obtain any type of free media on the subject so a
promotional still from the film *Karate Kid* is being used to show his
likeness.

1.  The image illustrates the text and the subject for which it appears.
    It describes the person which was being promoted
2.  It is a lower-resolution image of the original which was first
    printed in a magazine/game program in a larger format
3.  Using this image does not limit the copyright holders in anyway.
4.  The image has been posted to the web so its use on Wikipedia does
    not make it anymore accessible than before.
5.  The image is being used for informative purposes only.
6.  No free images of this person currently exist because they are
    deceased.

Air Quality Objectives (AQOs) in Hong Kong is specified by the Air Pollution Control Ordinance (APCO) (CAP 311). AQOs can be regarded as an aspirational target that the Hong Kong government would like to achieve better air quality in Hong Kong.

After the amendment of APCO in 2013, the review of Air Quality Objectives is to be initiated by the Hong Kong government for at least once every five years\[1\]. The air pollutant to be reviewed during the process include SO2, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, ozone, lead and CO.

The Environmental Protection Department is now reviewing the Air Quality Objectives for the second time since 2014. A review working group was set up in 2016 and the last review meeting was held in 18th Dec 2018. \[2\]

Specific Solvation is a common type of solvation, which arises as a result of formation of various types of complexes between the reacting particles and the solvent molecules. This type includes the formation of hydrogen onds between reacting particles and the solvent, the formation of Ï€-complexes and that of other donor-accept or complexes.

Non-Specific Solvation takes place in an arbitrary solutiono and is brought about by the interaction of the dissolved substance with the field of solvent molecules, i.e. in non-specific solvation, the medium acts on certain reacting particles like something whole, like a continuum. It should be divided further into non-polar and polar solvation . The former is governed by forces acting over a short distance, which exist between arbitrary molecules under reaction conditions. The seconde kind is of a purely electrostatic nature and is connected with action over longer distances. These later interactions play an important part only in the case of molecules having a comparatively large dipole moment and in ionic reactions.

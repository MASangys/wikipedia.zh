“[Who's
Next](../Page/Who's_Next.md "wikilink")”是英国摇滚乐队[谁人乐队的第五张录音室专辑](../Page/谁人乐队.md "wikilink")。它发展自一个由乐队成员[皮特·汤申德创作的作为乐队](../Page/皮特·汤申德.md "wikilink")1969年的专辑的多媒体摇滚歌剧项目，由于乐队与乐队经理人Kit
Lambert错综复杂的关系，该项目被取消了，但皮特·汤申德被说服录制其中一些歌曲作为通俗的专辑。

谁人乐队录制这张专辑受到录音师Glyn Johns的帮助。在滚石移动录音室录制“Won't Get Fooled
Again”之后，他们搬到伦敦奥林匹克录音室录制和混合该专辑剩余的大部分歌曲。他们在该专辑中突出地使用合成器，特别是在“Won't
Get Fooled Again”和“ Baba O'Riley ”之中，两首歌都是单曲发行。封面照片由Ethan
Russell摄制，参考了1968年电影[2001太空漫游中提到的巨石](../Page/2001太空漫遊_\(電影\).md "wikilink")（monolith），就像该封面上乐队成员背对有小便条纹的堆渣中的突出的混凝土桩。

“Who's
Next”在1971年8月发行后立刻获得成功。许多评论家认为它是谁人乐队的最佳唱片和有史以来最伟大的专辑之一。该专辑以CD形式再版了几次，再版包含了最初用于Lifehouse的曲目。

## 背景

到1970年，谁人乐队既受到了显著的批评又获得了商业成功，而他们已经开始与脱离原来的观众。[摩德文化已经消失](../Page/摩德文化.md "wikilink"),

and the original followers from Shepherd's Bush had grown up and
acquired jobs and families. The group had started to drift apart from
manager Kit Lambert due to his preoccupation with their label, Track
Records. They had been touring since the release of *Tommy* the previous
May, with a set that contained most of that album, but realized that
millions had now seen their live performances, and [Pete
Townshend](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Townshend "wikilink") in
particular recognized that they needed to do something new. A single,
"The Seeker", and a live album, *Live at Leeds* were released in 1970,
and an EP of new material ("Water", "Naked Eye", "I Don't Even Know
Myself", "Postcard" and "Now I'm a Farmer") was recorded, but not
released as the band felt it would not be a satisfactory follow-up to
*Tommy*.

Instead, the group tackled a project called *Lifehouse*. This evolved
from a series of columns Townshend wrote for *Melody Maker* in August
1970, in which he discussed the importance of rock music, and in
particular what the audience could do. Of all the group, he was the most
keen to use music as a communication device, and wanted to branch out
into other media, including film, to get away from the traditional album
/ tour cycle. Townshend has variously described *Lifehouse* as a
futuristic rock opera, a live-recorded concept album and as the music
for a scripted film project. The basic plot was outlined in an interview
Townshend gave to *Disc and Music Echo* on 24 October 1970. *Lifehouse*
is set in the near future in a society in which music is banned and most
of the population live indoors in government-controlled "experience
suits". A rebel, Bobby, broadcasts rock music into the suits, allowing
people to remove them and become more enlightened. Some elements
accurately describe future technology; for example, The Grid resembles
the internet and "grid sleep" virtual reality.

[G-6120_2.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:G-6120_2.jpg "fig:G-6120_2.jpg")
was given a [Gretsch
6120](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretsch_6120 "wikilink") guitar by
[Joe Walsh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Walsh "wikilink") in early
1971, and it became his main electric instrument for *Who's Next*.\]\]
The group held a press conference on 13 January 1971, explaining that
they would be giving a series of concerts at the Young Vic theatre,
where they would develop the fictional elements of the proposed film
along with the audience. After Keith Moon had completed his work on the
film *200 Motels*, the group performed their first Young Vic concert on
15 February. The show included a new quadrophonic public address system
which cost £30,000 and the audience was mainly invited from various
organisations such as youth clubs, with only a few tickets on sale to
the general public.

After the initial concerts, the group flew to New York's Record Plant
Studios at Lambert's suggestion, for studio recordings. The group were
joined by guests Al Kooper on Hammond organ, Ken Ascher on piano and
Leslie West on guitar. Townshend used a 1957 Gretsch guitar, given to
him by [Joe Walsh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Walsh "wikilink"),
during the session and it went on to become his main guitar for studio
recording. Lambert's participation in the recording was minimal, and he
proved to be unable to mix the final recordings. He had started taking
hard drugs, while Townshend was drinking brandy regularly. After
returning to Britain, engineer Glyn Johns made safety copies of the
Record Plant material but decided that it would be better to re-record
it from scratch at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes.

The group gave a further series of concerts at the Young Vic on 25 and
26 April, which were recorded on the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio by
Andy Johns, but Townshend grew disillusioned with *Lifehouse* and
further shows were cancelled. The project proved to be intractable on
several levels and caused stress within the band as well as a major
falling out between Townshend and Lambert. Years later, in the liner
notes to the remastered CD, Townshend wrote that the failure of the
project led him to the verge of a nervous breakdown. Audiences at the
Young Vic gigs were not interested in interacting with the group to
create new material, but simply wanted the Who to play "[My
Generation](../Page/My_Generation_\(歌曲\).md "wikilink")" and smash a
guitar. At the time, Roger Daltrey said the Who "were never nearer to
breaking up".

Although the *Lifehouse* concept was abandoned, scraps of the project
remained in the final album, including the use of synthesizers and
computers. An early concept for *Lifehouse* featured the feeding of
personal data from audience members into the controller of an early
analogue synthesizer to create a "universal chord" that would have ended
the proposed film. Abandoning *Lifehouse* gave the group extra freedom
due to the absence of an overriding musical theme or storyline (which
had been the basis of *Tommy*). This allowed the band to concentrate on
maximising the impact of individual tracks, and providing a unifying
sound for them.

Although he gave up his original intentions for the *Lifehouse* project,
Townshend continued to develop the concepts, revisiting them in later
albums, including a 6-CD set, *The Lifehouse Chronicles* in 1999. In
2007 he opened a website called The Lifehouse Method to accept personal
input from applicants that would be turned into musical portraits.\[1\]

[Barnes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes,_London "wikilink") with
[Glyn Johns](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyn_Johns "wikilink").\]\]
The first session for what became *Who's Next* was at [Mick
Jagger](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger "wikilink")'s house,
[Stargroves](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargroves "wikilink"), at
the start of April 1971, using the Rolling Stones Mobile. The backing
track of "[Won't Get Fooled
Again](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Won't_Get_Fooled_Again "wikilink")"
was recorded there before the band decided to relocate recording to
Olympic at Johns' suggestion; the first session was on 9 April,
attempting a basic take of
"[Bargain](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargain_\(song\) "wikilink")".
The bulk of the sessions occurred during May, when the group recorded
"Time is Passing", "[Pure and
Easy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_and_Easy "wikilink")", "[Love
Ain't for
Keeping](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Ain't_for_Keeping "wikilink")"
(which had been reworked from a rock track into an acoustic
arrangement), "[Behind Blue
Eyes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_Blue_Eyes "wikilink")", "[The
Song Is
Over](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Song_Is_Over "wikilink")",
"[Let's See
Action](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_See_Action "wikilink")" and
"[Baba O'Riley](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_O'Riley "wikilink")".
[Nicky Hopkins](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicky_Hopkins "wikilink")
guested on piano, while [Dave
Arbus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Arbus "wikilink") was invited
by Moon to play violin on "Baba O'Riley". [John
Entwistle](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Entwistle "wikilink")'s
"My Wife" was added to the album at the last minute late in the
sessions, and was originally intended for a solo album.

In contrast to the Record Plant and Young Vic sessions, recording with
Johns went well as he was primarily concerned about creating a good
sound, whereas Lambert had always been more preoccupied about the
group's image. Townshend recalled, "we were just getting astounded at
the sounds Glyn was producing". Townshend used the early synthesizers
and modified keyboard sounds in several modes: as a
[drone](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/drone_\(music\) "wikilink") effect
on several songs, notably "Baba O'Riley" and "Won't Get Fooled Again",
as well as on "Bargain", "Going Mobile" and "The Song Is Over". The
synthesizer was used as an integral part of the sound, as opposed to
providing gloss as was the case on other artists' albums up to this
point.  Moon's drumming had a distinctly different style from earlier
albums, being more formal and less reliant on long drum fills – partly
due to the synthesizer backing, but also due to the no-nonsense
production techniques of Johns, who insisted on a good recording
performance that only used flamboyancy when truly necessary. Johns was
instrumental in convincing the Who that they should simply put a single
studio album out, believing the songs to be excellent. The group gave
him free rein to assemble a single album of whatever songs he wanted in
any order. Despite Johns' key contributions, he only received an
associate producer credit on the finished album, though he maintained he
acted mainly in an engineering capacity and based most of the
arrangements on Townshend's original demos.

[ARP_2500.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ARP_2500.jpg "fig:ARP_2500.jpg")
synthesizer similar to the one used on *Who's Next*\]\] The album opened
with "Baba O'Riley", featuring piano and synthesizer-processed [Lowrey
organ](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowrey_organ "wikilink") by
Townshend. The song's title pays homage to Townshend's guru, [Meher
Baba](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meher_Baba "wikilink"), and
[minimalist](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/minimalism "wikilink")
composer [Terry
Riley](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Riley "wikilink") (and is
informally known as "Teenage Wasteland" from a line in the lyrics). The
organ track came from a longer demo by Townshend, portions of which were
later included on a Baba tribute album *I Am*, that was edited down for
the final recording. Townshend later said this part had "two or three
thousand edits to it". The opening lyrics to the next track, "Bargain",
"I'd gladly lose me to find you", came from a phrase used by Baba.
Entwistle wrote "My Wife" after having an argument with his wife and
exaggerating the conflict in the lyrics. The track features several
overdubbed brass instruments recorded in a single half-hour session.
"Pure and Easy", a key track from *Lifehouse*, did not make the final
track selection, but the opening line was included as a coda to "The
Song is Over".

"Behind Blue Eyes" featured three-part harmony by Daltrey, Townshend and
Entwistle and was written for the main antagonist in *Lifehouse*, Brick.
Moon, uncharacteristically, did not appear on the first half of the
track, which was later described by Who biographer Dave Marsh as "the
longest time Keith Moon was still in his entire life." The closing
track, "Won't Get Fooled Again", was critical of revolutions. Townshend
explained, "a revolution is only a revolution in the long run and a lot
of people are going to get hurt". The song features the Lowrey organ fed
through an
[ARP](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_Instruments "wikilink")
synthesizer, which came from Townshend's original demo and was re-used
for the finished track.

The [cover
artwork](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/cover_artwork "wikilink") shows a
photograph, taken at [Easington
Colliery](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easington_Colliery "wikilink"),
of the band apparently having just urinated on a large concrete piling
protruding from a [slag
heap](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/slag_heap "wikilink"). The decision
to shoot the picture came from Entwistle and Moon discussing [Stanley
Kubrick](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick "wikilink") and
the film *[2001: A Space
Odyssey](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_\(film\) "wikilink")*.\[2\]
According to photographer [Ethan
Russell](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Russell "wikilink"), most
of the band members were unable to urinate, so rainwater was tipped from
an empty film canister to achieve the desired effect. The rear cover
showed the band backstage at [De Montfort
Hall](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Montfort_Hall "wikilink"),
[Leicester](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester "wikilink"), amongst
a debris of furniture.  In 2003, the television channel
[VH1](../Page/VH1.md "wikilink") named *Who's Next*'s cover one of the
greatest album covers of all time.\[3\]

Other suggestions for the cover included the group urinating against a
[Marshall
Stack](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Stack "wikilink") and an
overweight nude woman with the Who's faces in place of her genitalia. An
alternative cover featuring Moon dressed in black
[lingerie](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/lingerie "wikilink") and a
brown wig, holding a whip, was later used for the inside art for the
1995 and 2003 CD releases. Some of the photographs taken during these
sessions were later used as part of Decca's United States promotion of
the album.\[4\]

shortly after *Who's Next* was released\]\] The lead single, "Won't Get
Fooled Again" (edited down to three and a half minutes), was released on
25 June 1971 in the UK and in July in the US ahead of the album. It
reached \#9 and \#15 in the charts respectively. The album was released
in August in the US and on 27 August in the UK. It became the only album
by the Who to top the UK charts.

The Who starting touring the US just before the album was released. The
group used the *Lifehouse* PA, though soundman [Bob
Pridden](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Pridden "wikilink") found the
technical requirements of the equipment to be over-complicated. The set
list was revamped, and while it included a smaller selection of numbers
from *Tommy*, several new numbers from the new album such as "My Wife",
"Baba O'Riley" and "Won't Get Fooled Again" became live favourites. The
latter two songs involved the band playing to a [backing
track](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/backing_track "wikilink")
containing the synthesizer parts. The tour moved to the UK in September,
including a show at [The
Oval](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oval "wikilink"),
[Kennington](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennington "wikilink") in
front of 35,000 fans, and the opening gig at the [Rainbow
Theatre](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Theatre "wikilink") in
Finsbury Park, before going back to the US, ending in
[Seattle](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle "wikilink") on December
15. The group then took eight months off touring, the longest break of
their career at that point.

Several additional songs recorded at the *Who's Next* sessions were
released later as singles or on compilations. "Let's See Action" was
released as a single in 1971, followed by "Join Together" in June 1972
and "Relay" in November. "Pure and Easy", "Put The Money Down" and "Too
Much of Anything" were released on the album *[Odds &
Sods](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_&_Sods "wikilink")*, while
"Time is Passing" was added to the 1998 CD version.\[5\] A cover of
"Baby Don't You Do It" was recorded and the longest version currently
available is on the deluxe edition of the album.

The album has been re-issued remastered several times using tapes from
different sessions. The master tapes for the Olympic sessions are
believed to be lost, as [Virgin
Records](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records "wikilink") threw
out a substantial number of old recordings when they purchased the
studio in the 1980s. Video game publisher
[Harmonix](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonix "wikilink") wanted to
release *Who's Next* as downloadable, playable content for the [music
video game](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/music_video_game "wikilink")
series *[Rock
Band](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Band "wikilink")*, but were
unable to do so due to difficulty finding the original [multi track
recordings](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/multi_track_recording "wikilink").
Instead, a compilation of Who songs dubbed "The Best of The Who," which
includes three of the album's songs ("Behind Blue Eyes", "Baba O'Riley",
and "Going Mobile"), was released as downloadable content, in lieu of
the earlier-promised *Who's Next* album.\[6\] The 16-track tapes to
"Won't Get Fooled Again" and the 8-track tapes to the other material
except "Bargain" and "Getting In Tune" have since been discovered.

## 评价和影响

In a contemporary review for *[The Village
Voice](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice "wikilink")*,
music critic [Robert
Christgau](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Christgau "wikilink")
called *Who's Next* "the best hard rock album in years" and said that,
while their previous recordings were marred by a thin sound, the group
now "achieves the same resonant immediacy in the studio that it does
live".\[7\] Billy Walker from
*[Sounds](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounds_\(magazine\) "wikilink")*
highlighted the songs "Baba O'Riley", "My Wife", and "The Song Is Over",
and wrote, "After the unique brilliance of *Tommy* something special had
to be thought out and the fact that they settled for a straight-forward
album rather than an extension of their rock opera, says much for their
courage and inventiveness."\[8\] *[Rolling
Stone](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "wikilink")*
magazine's [John
Mendelsohn](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mendelsohn_\(musician\) "wikilink")
felt that, despite some amount of seriousness and artificiality, the
album's brand of rock and roll is "intelligently-conceived,
superbly-performed, brilliantly-produced, and sometimes even
exciting".\[9\] At the end of 1971, the record was voted the best album
of the year in the [Pazz &
Jop](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazz_&_Jop "wikilink"), an annual
poll of American critics published by *The Village Voice*.\[10\]

Since then, *Who's Next* has often been viewed as the Who's best
album.\[11\] In a retrospective review for
[AllMusic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllMusic "wikilink"), [Stephen
Thomas
Erlewine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Thomas_Erlewine "wikilink")
said its music was more genuine than *Tommy* or the aborted *Lifehouse*
project because "those were art – \[*Who's Next*\], even with its
pretensions, is rock & roll."\[12\] [BBC
Music](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Music "wikilink")'s Chris
Roberts cited it as the band's best record and "one of those
carved-in-stone landmarks that the [rock
canon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/rockism "wikilink") doesn't allow
you to bad-mouth."\[13\]
*[Mojo](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_\(magazine\) "wikilink")*
claimed its sophisticated music and
[hook](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/hook_\(music\) "wikilink")-laden
songs featured innovative use of rock synthesizers that did not weaken
the Who's characteristic "power-quartet attack".\[14\] In *[The
Encyclopedia of Popular
Music](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Encyclopedia_of_Popular_Music "wikilink")*
(1998), [Colin
Larkin](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Larkin_\(writer\) "wikilink")
said it raised the standards for both hard rock and the Who, whose
"sense of
[dynamics](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/dynamics_\(music\) "wikilink")"
was highlighted by the
[contrast](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/contrast_\(music\) "wikilink")
between their powerful playing and a
[counterpoint](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/counterpoint "wikilink")
produced at times from acoustic guitars and synthesizer
[obbligatos](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/obbligato "wikilink").\[15\]
Christgau, on the other hand, was less enthusiastic about the record
during the 1980s when the Who became what he felt was "the worst kind of
art-rock band", writing that *Who's Next* revealed itself to be less
tasteful in retrospect because of Daltrey's histrionic singing and "all
that synth noodling".\[16\]

According to [Acclaimed
Music](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclaimed_Music "wikilink"), *Who's
Next* is the 35th most ranked record in critics' lists of the all-time
greatest albums.\[17\] In 2003, *[Rolling
Stone](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "wikilink")* ranked
it 28th on its list of [the 500 greatest albums of all
time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone's_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time "wikilink").\[18\]
The album appeared at number 15 on [Pitchfork
Media](../Page/Pitchfork_Media.md "wikilink")'s list of the 100 best
records from the 1970s.\[19\] It was also included in the book *[1001
Albums You Must Hear Before You
Die](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Albums_You_Must_Hear_Before_You_Die "wikilink")*
(2005).\[20\] The *Classic Albums*
[BBC](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "wikilink") documentary series
aired an episode on *Who's Next*, initially on radio in 1989, and then
on television in 1998,\[21\] which was released in 2006 on DVD as
*[Classic Albums: The Who – Who's
Next](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Albums:_The_Who_–_Who's_Next "wikilink")*.\[22\]
That year, the album was chosen by
*[Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "wikilink")* as
one of their 100 best records of all time.\[23\] In 2007, it was
inducted into the [Grammy Hall of
Fame](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Hall_of_Fame "wikilink") for
"lasting qualitative or historical significance".\[24\]

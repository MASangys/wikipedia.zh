[Yemen](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "wikilink") is located in
[Southwest
Asia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Asia "wikilink"), at the
southern tip of the [Arabian
Peninsula](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink"),
between [Oman](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman "wikilink") and [Saudi
Arabia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "wikilink"). It is
situated at the entrance to the
[Bab-el-Mandeb](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bab-el-Mandeb "wikilink")
Strait, which links the [Red
Sea](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea "wikilink") to the [Indian
Ocean](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "wikilink") (via the
[Gulf of Aden](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden "wikilink"))
and is one of the most active and strategic shipping lanes in the world.
Yemen has an area of , including the islands of
[Perim](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perim "wikilink") at the southern
end of the Red Sea and

Yemen occupies the southern end of the [Arabian
Plate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Plate "wikilink").\[2\]

The country's mountainous interior is surrounded by narrow coastal
plains to the west, south, and east and by upland desert to the north
along the border with Saudi Arabia. The
[Tihamah](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihamah "wikilink") is a nearly
long, semidesert coastal plain that runs along the [Red
Sea](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea "wikilink") and is part of
the [Arabian Peninsula coastal fog
desert](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula_coastal_fog_desert "wikilink")
[ecoregion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecoregion "wikilink").

The highland regions are interspersed with
[wadis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wadi "wikilink"), or river
valleys, that are dry in the winter months (Yemen has no permanent
rivers.) Most notable is the [Wadi
Hadhramaut](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi_Hadhramaut "wikilink") in
eastern Yemen, the upper portions of which contain alluvial soil and
floodwaters and the lower portion of which is barren and largely
uninhabited. Both the eastern plateau region and the desert in the north
are hot and dry with little vegetation.\[3\]

In the northeastern [Empty
Quarter](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_Quarter "wikilink"), sands
highlight the region, being the largest expanse of sand in the world. It
receives little to no rain for extensive periods of time. Little
vegetation grows here either.

The central highlands are drier than the western highlands because of
rain-shadow influences, but still receives sufficient rain in wet years
for extensive cropping. Its [diurnal temperature
variations](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/diurnal_temperature_variation "wikilink")
are among the highest in the world: ranges from  in the day to  at night
are normal. Water storage allows for irrigation and the growing of wheat
and barley while the western highlands are famous for
[sorghum](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorghum "wikilink"),
[coffee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/coffee "wikilink"), and some
tropical fruits like bananas and mangos.

## Elevation

Yemen is a continuously elevated country, with only the coastal plains
being the lowest-lying areas. Jagged peaks and plateaus cover most of
Yemen, and the average elevation in the country is about . The interior
mountains have elevations ranging from a few hundred meters to the
country's highest point, [Jabal An-Nabi
Shu'ayb](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabal_An-Nabi_Shu'ayb "wikilink"),
which is  above sea level.\[4\]\[5\] The range of elevation is thus from
[sea level](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/sea_level "wikilink") to , and
among the countries in the Arab world, it is the one with the second
highest high point, after
[Morocco](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco "wikilink")'s  high
[Jbel Toubkal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jbel_Toubkal "wikilink").
The Yemenis used the elevation of their homeland to stay isolated for
thousands of years with foreign trade conducted only when the Yemenis
wished to go to the coastal areas. The mountains are young, jagged peaks
that are known to rise from an elevation of a few hundred meters to well
over . The mountains can be separated into a western and central
highland. The western highlands have peaks reaching around , with
relatively fertile soil and sufficient and plentiful rainfall. The
central highlands is more like a plateau of about , with rolling hills,
small knolls, and some very prominent peaks, but is still relatively
more elevated. Less rainfall can be seen in this region, but the summer
months give enough to sustain crops.

## Climate

Temperatures are generally very high in Yemen, particularly in the
coastal regions. Rainfall is limited, with variations based on
elevation. The highlands enjoy a temperate, rainy summer with an average
high temperature of  and a cool, moderately dry winter with temperatures
occasionally dipping below . The climate of the
[Tihamah](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihamah "wikilink") (western
coastal plain) is tropical; temperatures occasionally exceed , and the
humidity ranges from 50 to 70 percent. Rainfall, which comes in
irregular heavy torrents, averages  annually. In Aden the average
temperature is  in January and  in June, but with highs often exceeding
. Average annual rainfall is . The highest mountainous areas of southern
Yemen receive from  of rain a year. Some areas of the western highlands,
most notably Ibb and Ta'izz, receive from about  of rain each year. The
capital, Sana'a, receives around  a year, it is not uncommon for the
northern and eastern sections of the country to receive no rain for five
years or more. The Wadi Hadhramaut in the eastern part of Yemen is arid
and hot, and the humidity ranges from 35 percent in June to 64 percent
in January. Yemen is dry in the east and humid in the west.

## Coastline and maritime claims

Yemen has  of coastline along the [Arabian
Sea](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Sea "wikilink"), the [Gulf of
Aden](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden "wikilink"), and the
Red Sea. Yemen claims a territorial sea of , a contiguous zone of , an
exclusive economic zone of , and a continental shelf of  or to the edge
of the continental margin.\[6\]

## Natural resources

Yemen's principal natural resources are oil and natural gas as well as
agriculturally productive land in the west. Other natural resources
include fish and seafood, rock salt, marble, and minor deposits of
[coal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/coal "wikilink"),
[gold](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/gold "wikilink"),
[lead](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/lead "wikilink"),
[nickel](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/nickel "wikilink"), and
[copper](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/copper "wikilink").\[7\]

## Land use

Only 2.91 percent of Yemen is considered to be arable land, and less
than 0.6 percent of the land is planted with permanent crops. About  of
the land is irrigated. According to the [United
Nations](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "wikilink"), Yemen
has  of forest and other wooded land, which constitutes almost 4 percent
of total land area.\[8\]

## Environmental factors

Yemen is subject to sandstorms and dust storms, resulting in soil
erosion and crop damage. The country has very limited natural freshwater
and consequently inadequate supplies of potable water.
[Desertification](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification "wikilink")
([land
degradation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/land_degradation "wikilink")
caused by aridity) and overgrazing are also problems.\[9\] It is a party
to international
[Biodiversity](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "wikilink"),
Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental
Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, and [Ozone Layer
Protection](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_Layer_Protection "wikilink")
agreements.\[10\]

## Disputed territory

A long-standing dispute between Saudi Arabia and Yemen was resolved in
June 2000 with the signing of the [Treaty of
Jeddah](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Jeddah_\(2000\) "wikilink").
This agreement provides coordinates for use in delineating the land and
maritime border, including the section in the eastern desert region of
Yemen that potentially contains significant amounts of oil. Friction
between the two countries in recent years over security of the borders
appears to have been alleviated by the establishment of joint border
patrols.

Following years of dispute between Yemen and
[Eritrea](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea "wikilink") over
ownership of the [Hanish
Islands](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanish_Islands "wikilink") and
fishing rights in the Red Sea, in 1999 an international arbitration
panel awarded sovereignty of the islands to Yemen. Relations between the
two countries remain strained, however, and Yemen continues to protest
Eritrean fishing in the disputed territory.\[11\]

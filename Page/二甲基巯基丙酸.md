**二甲基巯基丙酸**（，缩写**DMSP**）是一种[化学式为](../Page/化学式.md "wikilink")(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sup>+</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>的[有机化合物](../Page/有机化合物.md "wikilink")，常以[內盐形式存在于海洋](../Page/两性离子.md "wikilink")[浮游植物](../Page/浮游植物.md "wikilink")、[海藻以及其它陆生及水生](../Page/海藻.md "wikilink")[维管植物中](../Page/维管植物.md "wikilink")。
It functions as an
[osmolyte](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/osmolyte "wikilink") as well as
several other physiological and environmental roles have also been
identified.\[1\] DMSP was first identified in the marine red alga
*Polysiphonia fastigiata* by Frederick Challenger and Margaret Simpson
(later Dr. Whitaker) \[2\]

## 生物合成

In higher plants, DMSP is biosynthesized from
[S-Methylmethionine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Methylmethionine "wikilink").
Two intermediates in this conversion are dimethylsulfoniumpropylamine
and dimethylsulfoniumpropionaldehyde.\[3\] In algae, however, the
biosynthesis starts with removal of the amino group from
[Methionine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine "wikilink"),
rather than from S-Methylmethionine.

## 降解

DMSP is broken down by marine microbes to form two major volatile sulfur
products, each with distinct effects on the environment. Its major
breakdown product is
[methanethiol](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/methanethiol "wikilink")
(CH<sub>3</sub>SH), which is assimilated by bacteria into
[protein](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/protein "wikilink") sulfur. Its
second volatile breakdown product is [dimethyl
sulfide](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimethyl_sulfide "wikilink")
(CH<sub>3</sub>SCH<sub>3</sub>; DMS). Most DMS in seawater is cleaved
from DMSP by the enzyme
DMSP-[lyase](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/lyase "wikilink"), although
many non-marine species of bacteria convert methanethiol to DMS.

DMS is also taken up by marine
[bacteria](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/bacteria "wikilink"), but not
as rapidly as methanethiol. Although DMS usually consists of less than
25% of the volatile breakdown products of DMSP, the high reactivity of
methanethiol makes the steady-state DMS concentrations in seawater
approximately 10 times those of methanethiol
(\~3 [nM](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_\(unit\) "wikilink") vs.
\~0.3 nM). Curiously, there have never been any published correlations
between the concentrations of DMS and methanethiol. This is probably due
to the non-linear
[abiotic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/abiotic "wikilink") and
microbial uptake of methanethiol in seawater, and the comparatively low
reactivity of DMS. However, a significant portion of DMS in seawater is
[oxidized](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/redox "wikilink") to [dimethyl
sulfoxide](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimethyl_sulfoxide "wikilink")
(DMSO).

Relevant to [global
climate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_climate "wikilink"), DMS
is thought to play a role in the Earth's heat budget by decreasing the
amount of [solar
radiation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_radiation "wikilink")
that reaches the Earth's surface.

DMSP has also been implicated in influencing the taste and odour
characteristics of various products. For example, although DMSP is
odourless and tasteless, it is accumulated at high levels in some marine
[herbivores](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/herbivory "wikilink") or
[filter
feeders](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/filter_feeder "wikilink").
Increased growth rates, vigour and stress resistance among animals
cultivated on such diets have been reported. DMS, is responsible for
repellent, 'off' tastes and odours that develop in some seafood products
because of the action of bacterial DMSP-lyase, which cogenerates
[acrylate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/acrylate "wikilink").

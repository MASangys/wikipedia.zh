**圣达味**，俗称**聖大衛**（Saint David；；；約）是6世紀的一位[威爾士](../Page/威爾士.md "wikilink")聖人，現在是威爾士的[主保聖人](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/主保聖人 "wikilink")。傳說中，他是聖嫩（Saint Non）之子，[锡尔迪金王国](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/锡尔迪金王国 "wikilink")（Kingdom of Ceredigion）國王[锡尔迪格](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/锡尔迪格 "wikilink")（Ceredig）之孫\[1\]。他的傳說故事多來自11世紀的圣徒传记《大衛傳》（Buchedd Dewi）。 他最著名的聖跡發生於威爾士小村[兰德威布莱菲](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/兰德威布莱菲 "wikilink")（Llanddewi Brefi），他在這裡講道時，他所站之處高高隆起，形成一座小山，一隻白色的鴿子停在了他的肩膀上。\[2\]

## Monasticism

Many of the traditional tales about David are found in the *Buchedd Dewi* ("Life of David"), a [hagiography](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/hagiography "wikilink") written by [Rhygyfarch](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhygyfarch "wikilink") in the late 11th century. Rhygyfarch claimed it was based on documents found in the cathedral archives. Modern historians are sceptical of some of its claims: one of Rhygyfarch's aims was to establish some independence for the Welsh church, which had refused the Roman rite until the 8th century and now sought a metropolitan status equal to that of Canterbury. (This may apply to the supposed pilgrimage to [Jerusalem](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "wikilink") where he is said to have been anointed as an archbishop by the [patriarch](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Patriarch_of_Jerusalem "wikilink")).

The tradition that he was born at [Henfynyw](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henfynyw "wikilink") (Vetus-Menevia) in [Ceredigion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceredigion "wikilink") is not improbable.\[3\] He became renowned as a teacher and preacher, founding monastic settlements and churches in Wales, [Dumnonia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumnonia "wikilink"), and [Brittany](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany "wikilink"). [St David's Cathedral](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_David's_Cathedral "wikilink") stands on the site of the monastery he founded in the Glyn Rhosyn valley of [Pembrokeshire](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire "wikilink"). Around 550, he attended the [Synod of Brefi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Brefi "wikilink"), where his eloquence in opposing [Pelagianism](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagianism "wikilink") caused his fellow monks to elect him primate of the region. As such he presided over the synod of [Caerleon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerleon "wikilink") (the "[Synod of Victory](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Victory "wikilink")") around 569.\[4\]

## Legend

[Clonard_RC_Church_St_Finian_02_Detail_2007_08_26.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clonard_RC_Church_St_Finian_02_Detail_2007_08_26.jpg "fig:Clonard_RC_Church_St_Finian_02_Detail_2007_08_26.jpg") in a stained glass window at [Clonard](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonard,_County_Meath "wikilink")\]\]

His best-known [miracle](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/miracle "wikilink") is said to have taken place when he was preaching in the middle of a large crowd at the Synod of Brefi: the village of [Llanddewi Brefi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanddewi_Brefi "wikilink") stands on the spot where the ground on which he stood is reputed to have risen up to form a small hill. A white dove, which became his emblem, was seen settling on his shoulder. [John Davies](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Davies_\(historian\) "wikilink") notes that one can scarcely "conceive of any miracle more superfluous" in that part of Wales than the creation of a new hill.\[5\] David is said to have denounced [Pelagianism](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagianism "wikilink") during this incident and he was declared archbishop by popular acclaim according to Rhygyfarch,\[6\] bringing about the retirement of [Dubricius](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubricius "wikilink"). St David's [metropolitan status](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_St_David's#Claim_of_metropolitan_status "wikilink") as an archbishopric was later supported by [Bernard, Bishop of St David's](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard,_Bishop_of_St_David's "wikilink"), [Geoffrey of Monmouth](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_of_Monmouth "wikilink") and [Gerald of Wales](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_of_Wales "wikilink").

The [Monastic Rule](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_rule "wikilink") of David prescribed that monks had to pull the [plough](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/plough "wikilink") themselves without draught animals,\[7\] must drink only water and eat only bread with salt and herbs, and spend the evenings in prayer, reading and writing. No personal possessions were allowed: even to say "my book" was considered an offence. He lived a [simple life](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/simple_living "wikilink") and practised [asceticism](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/asceticism "wikilink"), teaching his followers to [refrain from eating meat](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/vegetarianism "wikilink") and drinking [beer](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/beer "wikilink"). His symbol, also the symbol of Wales, is the [leek](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/leek "wikilink") (this inspires a reference in [Shakespeare](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "wikilink")'s Henry V, Act V scene 1) :

*Fluellen: "If your Majesty is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their [Monmouth caps](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouth_caps "wikilink"), which your Majesty knows, to this hour is an honourable badge of the service, and I do believe, your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy's day". King Henry: "I wear it for a memorable honour; for I am Welsh, you know, good countryman".*

### Connections to Glastonbury

[Rhigyfarch](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhigyfarch "wikilink") counted [Glastonbury Abbey](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Abbey "wikilink") among the churches David founded.\[8\] Around forty years later [William of Malmesbury](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Malmesbury "wikilink"), believing the Abbey older, said that David visited [Glastonbury](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury "wikilink") only to rededicate the Abbey and to donate a travelling altar including a great [sapphire](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/sapphire "wikilink"). He had had a vision of [Jesus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus "wikilink") who said that "the church had been dedicated long ago by Himself in honour of His Mother, and it was not seemly that it should be re-dedicated by human hands". So David instead commissioned an extension to be built to the abbey, east of the Old Church. (The dimensions of this extension given by William were verified archaeologically in 1921). One manuscript indicates that a sapphire altar was among the items [Henry VIII of England](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England "wikilink") confiscated from the abbey during the [Dissolution of the Monasteries](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries "wikilink") a thousand years later.

## Death

[Shrine_of_St_David.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shrine_of_St_David.jpg "fig:Shrine_of_St_David.jpg"), prior to its reconstruction in the early twenty-first century.\]\] [StDavidsCathedral.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:StDavidsCathedral.jpg "fig:StDavidsCathedral.jpg"), current day, restored to its 1181 appearance.
([St Davids](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Davids "wikilink"), [Pembrokeshire](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire "wikilink"))\]\]

Though the exact date of his death is not certain, tradition holds that it was on 1 March, which is the date now marked as [Saint David's Day](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_David's_Day "wikilink").\[9\] The two most common years given for his death are 601 and 589. The monastery is said to have been "filled with angels as Christ received his soul". His last words to his followers were in a sermon on the previous Sunday. The Welsh Life of St David gives these as, "Arglwydi, vrodyr, a chwioryd, Bydwch lawen a chedwch ych ffyd a'ch cret, a gwnewch y petheu bychein a glywyssawch ac a welsawch gennyf i. A mynheu a gerdaf y fford yd aeth an tadeu idi",\[10\] which translates as, "Lords, brothers and sisters, Be joyful, and keep your faith and your creed, and do the little things that you have seen me do and heard about. And as for me, I will walk the path that our fathers have trod before us." "Do ye the little things in life" ("Gwnewch y pethau bychain mewn bywyd") is today a very well known phrase in Welsh. The same passage states that he died on a Tuesday, from which attempts have been made to calculate the year of his death.

David was buried at [St David's Cathedral](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_David's_Cathedral "wikilink") at [St Davids](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Davids "wikilink"), [Pembrokeshire](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire "wikilink"), where his [shrine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/shrine "wikilink") was a popular place of pilgrimage throughout the [Middle Ages](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "wikilink"). During the 10th and 11th centuries the Cathedral was regularly raided by [Vikings](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings "wikilink"), who removed the shrine from the church and stripped off the precious metal adornments. In 1275 a new shrine was constructed, the ruined base of which remains to this day (see photo), which was originally surmounted by an ornamental wooden canopy with murals of David, [Patrick](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick "wikilink") and [Denis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis "wikilink"). The relics of David and [Justinian of Ramsey Island](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_of_Ramsey_Island "wikilink") were kept in a portable casket on the stone base of the shrine. It was at this shrine that Edward I came to pray in 1284. During the reformation Bishop Barlow (1536–48), a staunch Protestant, stripped the shrine of its jewels and confiscated the relics of David and Justinian.

## Veneration

David was officially recognised at the [Holy See](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "wikilink") by [Pope Callixtus II](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Callixtus_II "wikilink") in 1120, thanks to the work of [Bernard, Bishop of St David's](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_\(bishop_of_St_Davids\) "wikilink"). Music for his [Liturgy of the Hours](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy_of_the_Hours "wikilink") has been edited by O. T. Edwards in *Matins, Lauds and Vespers for St David's Day: the Medieval Office of the Welsh Patron Saint in National Library of Wales MS 20541 E* (Cambridge, 1990). David was also canonized by the [Eastern Orthodox Church](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "wikilink") at an unknown date.

Over 50 churches in South Wales were dedicated to him in pre-Reformation days.\[11\]

In the 2004 edition of the [Roman Martyrology](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Martyrology "wikilink"), David is listed under 1 March with the Latin name *Dávus*. He is recognised as bishop of Menevia in Wales who governed his monastery following the example of the [Eastern Fathers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers "wikilink"). Through his leadership, many monks went forth to evangelise Wales, Ireland, Cornwall and [Armorica](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armorica "wikilink") (Brittany and surrounding provinces).\[12\]

The restored Shrine of Saint David was unveiled and rededicated by the [Right Reverend](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Reverend "wikilink") [Wyn Evans](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyn_Evans "wikilink"), [Bishop of St David's](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_St_David's "wikilink"), at a [Choral Eucharist](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist "wikilink") on Saint David's Day, 2012.

A [broadside ballad](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/broadside_ballad "wikilink") published around 1630 claimed that the Welsh wore a [leek](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/leek "wikilink") in their hats to commemorate a battle fought on St David's Day. So as to recognise friend from foe, the Welsh had pulled up leeks from a garden and put them in their hats, before going on to win the battle.\[13\]

### Iconography

He is usually represented standing on a little hill, with a dove on his shoulder.\[14\]

## Reputation

[Flag_of_Saint_David.svg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Saint_David.svg "fig:Flag_of_Saint_David.svg")\]\] David's popularity in Wales is shown by the *[Armes Prydein](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armes_Prydein "wikilink")* of around 930, a popular poem which prophesied that in the future, when all might seem lost, the *Cymry* ([Welsh people](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_people "wikilink")) would unite behind the standard of David to defeat the English; "A lluman glân Dewi a ddyrchafant" ("And they will raise the pure banner of Dewi").

David is said to have played a role in spreading Christianity on the continent, inspiring numerous place names in Brittany including [Saint-Divy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Divy "wikilink"), [Saint-Yvi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Yvi "wikilink") and [Landivy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landivy "wikilink").

David's life and teachings have inspired a choral work by Welsh composer [Karl Jenkins](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Jenkins "wikilink"), *Dewi Sant*. It is a seven-movement work best known for the classical crossover series [Adiemus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiemus_\(albums\) "wikilink"), which intersperses movements reflecting the themes of David's last sermon with those drawing from three Psalms. An [oratorio](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/oratorio "wikilink") by another Welsh composer [Arwel Hughes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arwel_Hughes "wikilink"), also entitled *Dewi Sant*, was composed in 1950.

Saint David is also thought to be associated with [corpse candles](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/corpse_candles "wikilink"), lights that would warn of the imminent death of a member of the community. The story goes that David prayed for his people to have some warning of their death, so that they could prepare themselves. In a vision, David's wish was granted and told that from then on, people who lived in the land of Dewi Sant (Saint David) "would be forewarned by the dim light of mysterious tapers when and where the death might be expected". The colour and size of the tapers indicated whether the person to die would be a woman, man, or child.\[15\]

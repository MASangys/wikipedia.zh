**埃莱奥诺拉·朱莉娅·阿玛莉亚·杜斯**（Eleonora Giulia Amalia Duse；1858年10月3日——1924年4月21日）, 是一位[意大利](../Page/意大利.md "wikilink")演员，简称**杜斯**（**Duse**）。她被认为是有史以来最伟大的女演员之一，她以演技出神入化而闻名。1947年，后人为她拍摄了一部名为《**埃莱奥诺拉·杜斯**》（*原文名称：Eleonora Duse）*的传记电影。



## 生平

埃莱奥诺拉·杜斯出生于[撒丁王国](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/撒丁王国 "wikilink")（今属[意大利](../Page/意大利.md "wikilink")）[维杰瓦诺](../Page/维杰瓦诺.md "wikilink")，并在该地度过了她的童年时光。4周岁时，她随同是演员的父亲进入[意大利](../Page/意大利.md "wikilink")[基奥贾的一家剧团做了演员](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/基奥贾 "wikilink")。早年的埃莱奥诺拉·杜斯家境贫寒，因而早早的随家人在剧团中工作，居住城市及工作单位也反复更换。她因在[意大利](../Page/意大利.md "wikilink")出演歌剧《[茶花女](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/茶花女_\(歌剧\) "wikilink")》时的所表现出的出色演技而一举成名，被人们称为“意大利的[莎拉·伯恩哈特](../Page/莎拉·伯恩哈特.md "wikilink")”。 She gained her first major success in Europe, then toured South America, Russia and the United States in 1893; beginning the tours as a virtual unknown but leaving in her wake a general recognition of her genius. While she made her career and fame performing in the theatrical "[warhorses](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/:wikt:warhorse "wikilink")" of her day, she is today remembered more for her association with the plays of [Gabriele d'Annunzio](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriele_d'Annunzio "wikilink") and [Henrik Ibsen](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen "wikilink"). In regard to her general character, it is important to note that reading was a lifelong passion.

In 1879, while in [Naples](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples "wikilink"), she met journalist Martino Cafiero, and became involved in a fast-paced love affair with him. However, less than a year later, while she was in mid-pregnancy, he left her. The baby did not survive birth, and shortly thereafter Cafiero died as well. Duse then joined [Cesare Rossi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Rossi_\(actor\) "wikilink")'s theater company, and met actor Tebaldo Checchi (pseudonym of Tebaldo Marchetti). The two married in 1881. By 1885, the couple had one daughter, Enrichetta, but divorced after Duse became involved with another actor, Flavio Andò. [Eleonora_Duse_von_Lenbach.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eleonora_Duse_von_Lenbach.jpg "fig:Eleonora_Duse_von_Lenbach.jpg")绘制的**埃莱奥诺拉·杜斯**画像\]\] By this time, her career was in full swing and her popularity began to climb. She travelled on tour to South America, and upon her return a year later she formed her own company, meaning that she would assume the additional responsibilities of both manager and director.

Between 1887 and 1894 she had an affair with the Italian poet [Arrigo Boito](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrigo_Boito "wikilink"), perhaps best remembered as [Verdi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdi "wikilink")'s librettist. Their relationship was carried out in a highly clandestine manner, presumably because of Boito's many aristocratic friends and acquaintances. (Despite this, their voluminous correspondence over the years survives.) In later years the two remained on good terms until his death in 1918.

In 1895 she met [Gabriele d'Annunzio](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriele_d'Annunzio "wikilink") (1863–1938), who was five years her junior, and the two became involved romantically as well as collaborating professionally. Gabriele d'Annunzio wrote four plays for her. In contrast to her relations with Boito, her association with d'Annunzio was widely recognized. When d'Annunzio gave the lead for the premiere of the play *La Città morta* to Sarah Bernhardt instead of Duse, there was a furious fight, and Duse ended her affair with him.

In contrast to Bernhardt's outgoing personality, which thrived on publicity, Duse was introverted and private, rarely giving interviews. She found public appearances to be a distraction, and once remarked to a journalist that away from the stage, "I do not exist". Bernhardt and Duse were unspoken rivals for many years. Comparisons of Duse to Bernhardt with regard to their acting talent were common, with warring factions arguing over their relative merits. Those who thought Duse the greater artist included [George Bernard Shaw](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw "wikilink"), who saw both actresses in London within the span of a few days, in the same play. Shaw gave his nod to Duse and defended his choice in an adamant oratory quoted by biographer Frances Winwar. [Ellen Terry](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Terry "wikilink"), a famous British actress of the era who knew both well, observed "How futile it is to make comparisons\! Better far to thank heaven for both these women."

In 1896, Duse completed a triumphant tour of the United States; in Washington President [Grover Cleveland](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Cleveland "wikilink") and his wife attended every performance. Mrs. Cleveland shocked Washington society by giving in Duse's honor the first-ever White House tea held for an actress. In 1909 Duse retired from acting.



## 个人轶事

埃莱奥诺拉·杜斯退休后，与意大利[女权主义者莉娜](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/女权主义者 "wikilink")·波莱蒂（Lina Poletti）发生了同性恋关系，她曾是作家[西比拉·阿勒拉莫](../Page/西比拉·阿勒拉莫.md "wikilink")（Sibilla Aleramo）情人，两人在意大利的佛罗伦萨同居了两年，才结束了这段同性恋关系。

有传言称埃莱奥诺拉·杜斯和舞蹈家[艾莎道拉·邓肯](../Page/艾莎道拉·邓肯.md "wikilink")（Isadora Duncan）也存在同性恋关系。埃莱奥诺拉·杜斯于1913年和她一起在[意大利](../Page/意大利.md "wikilink")海滨度假胜地[维亚雷焦共同旅游了几个星期](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/维亚雷焦 "wikilink")，当时这位舞蹈家的两个孩子溺水而亡。

她还以指导公司中的许多年轻女演员而闻名，其中最著名的是[Emma Gramatica](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Gramatica "wikilink")；她和歌手伊维特·吉尔伯特（Yvette Guilbert）有着持久而亲密的友谊。她还与女装设计师吉恩·菲利浦·沃思（Jean Philippe Worth）有着长久的友谊，后者对她非常忠诚。



## Acting philosophy

[Eleanora_Duse.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eleanora_Duse.jpg "fig:Eleanora_Duse.jpg") Duse was famously cryptic regarding her acting style. She claimed not to have a technique of any sort, and scorned at efforts to put her art into a science. What is known is that she had a highly heterodox, almost religious philosophy of acting, seeking to "eliminate the self" and become the characters she portrayed. It is a common misconception that her acting was purely intuitive and spontaneous, in reality she labored over her craft.

Her biographer, [Frances Winwar](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Winwar "wikilink"), records that Duse wore little makeup but, "...made herself up morally. In other words, she allowed the inner compulsions, grief and joys of her characters to use her body as their medium for expression, often to the detriment of her health."\[1\] According to the [*Encyclopædia Britannica* Eleventh Edition](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopædia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition "wikilink"), "her art depended on intense naturalness rather than stage effect, sympathetic force and poignant intellectuality rather than the theatrical emotionalism of the French tradition."\[2\]

Over the course of her career, Duse became well-known and respected for her assistance to young actors and actresses during the early stages of their careers. Among diverse artistic geniuses who acknowledged being inspired by Duse are [modern dance](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_dance "wikilink") pioneer [Martha Graham](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Graham "wikilink") and [Imagist](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagist "wikilink") poetry pioneer [Amy Lowell](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Lowell "wikilink"). She was great friends with actress [Eva Le Gallienne](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Le_Gallienne "wikilink"), who wrote her biography.

## Later life

Duse suffered from ill health (largely [pulmonary](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_lung "wikilink")) throughout most of her adult life, and the many years of touring had taken their toll.

She retired from acting in 1909, but returned to the stage in 1921 in a series of engagements in both Europe and America.\[3\] During this interval, in 1916, she made one film *[Cenere](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenere "wikilink")* ("Ashes"), prints of which still survive. She was very disappointed in her work, and later wrote to the French singer [Yvette Guilbert](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Guilbert "wikilink") with the request not to see “that stupid thing, because you’ll find nothing, or almost nothing, of me in that film.” There was also a certain amount of professional correspondence between Duse and [D.W. Griffith](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.W._Griffith "wikilink"), though ultimately nothing came of this.

On 30 July 1923 Duse became the first woman (and Italian) to be featured on the cover of the nascent magazine *[Time](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "wikilink")*.

Duse died of [pneumonia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/pneumonia "wikilink") at the age of 65 in Pittsburgh in Suite 524 of the Hotel Schenley while on the eastward return leg of a tour of the United States. (The Hotel Schenley is now the [William Pitt Union](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt_Union "wikilink") at the University of Pittsburgh.) A bronze plaque in the lobby commemorates her death. After being moved to New York City, where she [lay in state](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/lay_in_state "wikilink") for four days before her funeral service, her body was returned to Italy (where another service was performed). She is buried in [Asolo](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asolo "wikilink") – where she had made her home for the last four years of her life – at the cemetery of Sant' Anna.\[4\]

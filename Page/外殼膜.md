## 軟體動物

### 成份

軟體動物的外殻膜是一層覆蓋在新鮮殻表面的纖維狀角質物，這種角質蛋白叫作，主要由[醌](../Page/醌.md "wikilink")[鞣製的蛋白質組成](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/鞣製 "wikilink")，與其他生物[上皮組織](../Page/上皮組織.md "wikilink")組成的[角質層](../Page/角質層.md "wikilink")相似\[2\]。

### 功能

The formation of a shell requires certain biological machinery. The shell is deposited within a small compartment, the extrapallial space, which is sealed from the environment by the periostracum, a leathery outer layer around the rim of the shell, where growth occurs. This caps of the extrapallial space, which is bounded on its other surfaces by the existing shell and the mantle.\[3\] The periostracum acts as a framework from which the outer layer of carbonate can be suspended, but also, in sealing the compartment, allows the accumulation of ions in concentrations sufficient for crystallization to occur. The accumulation of ions is driven by ion pumps packed within the calcifying epithelium. The organic matrix forms the scaffold that directs crystallization, and the deposition and rate of crystals is also controlled by hormones produced by the mollusc.\[4\] The periostracum was probably essential in allowing early molluscs to obtain large size with a single valve.\[5\]

The periostracum is secreted from a groove in the mantle, termed the periostracal groove. When secreted, it consists of the soluble protein periostracin; this polymer becomes insoluble through a tanning process involving quinone.\[6\]

### Description

Periostracum is often yellowish or brownish in color. In some species it is black. The periostracum is very often a different color than the underlying layer of the shell.

In the shells of species which have periostracum, this shell layer is quite often physically worn away or chemically eroded in the parts of the shell that are older, thus it may only still be visible in the more recently formed areas of the shell.

Periostracum can in some cases be quite thin, smooth, glossy and transparent, such that it looks almost like a thin yellow [varnish](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/varnish "wikilink"), or it can be thicker and more or less opaque. When it is thick it is often relatively rough in texture and dull. In some species the periostracum is tufted, or forms hair-like growths which in some cases can give the fresh shell a velvety feel, see. In some species the periostracum adheres very tightly to the underlying shell surface, in others the periostracum is less firmly attached.

In certain marine species, such as for example certain species of [cone snails](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/cone_snail "wikilink"), a heavy periostracum obscures the color patterns that exist on the calcareous layer of the shell.

In many aquatic species, once a shell has been removed from the water and has had time to completely dry out, then the periostracum may become brittle and start to flake or peel off of the surface of the shell.

It is not uncommon for shell collectors to deliberately remove a periostracum layer (using household bleach) if they feel that a shell is more attractive without it. However the periostracum is an important part of the shell, and is definitely of interest to [malacologists](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/malacologist "wikilink"). Details of the periostracum can sometimes be very helpful in identifying a species.

#### Hairs on gastropod shells

Haired shells occur in [gastropods](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastropod "wikilink") in several species of the [Stylommatophoran](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylommatophora "wikilink") families [Polygyridae](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyridae "wikilink"), [Helicidae](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicidae "wikilink") and [Hygromiidae](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygromiidae "wikilink"). These families are only distantly related, suggesting that this features has evolved several times independently. Haired shells are almost exclusively observed in species living in moist microhabitats, like layers of fallen leaves, broad-leaved vegetation, damp meadows or wet scree. Such a correlation suggests an adaptive significance of the trait in such a habitat; it was thus speculated that the hydrophobic hairs facilitate the movement in wet environments by relieving surface tension.\[7\]

These hairs can reach varying densities (up to 20 per squaremilimetre) and lengths (up to three millimetres). In some cases hardly visible, they confer an almost furry impression to the shell in others. These semi-rigid structures are part of the periostracum, a thin protein layer ([conchiolin](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/conchiolin "wikilink")) secreted by the snail to cover the calcareous shell. Building hairs requires the snail to have specialised glandular tissue and complex strategies to form them. Consequently, this trait can be assumed to be costly and should thus present a selective advantage to its bearers in order to be conserved.\[8\]

Experiments by Pfenninger et al. (2005)\[9\] on genus *[Trochulus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochulus "wikilink")* showed an increased adherence of haired shells to wet surfaces. Haired shells appeared to be the [ancestral character](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/plesiomorph "wikilink") state, a feature most probably lost three times independently. The possession of hairs facilitates the adherence of the snails to their herbaceous food plants during foraging when humidity levels are high. The absence of hairs in some *Trochulus* species could thus be explained as a loss of the potential adaptive function linked to habitat shifts.\[10\]

## 腕足动物

[腕足动物门](../Page/腕足动物门.md "wikilink")的外殼膜在不同物種由不同成份組成，包括有：[糖胺聚糖及](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/糖胺聚糖 "wikilink")[甲殼素](../Page/甲殼素.md "wikilink")、[幾丁質或](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/幾丁質 "wikilink")[蛋白质](../Page/蛋白质.md "wikilink")，當中以幾丁質為主。 在這些腕足动物的外套膜邊沿上相對比較新的細胞所分泌的物質將外殻膜延展，但又會被其外套膜上層較新的細胞所取代，然後轉變功能成為為其外殻分泌礦物質構築物的細胞\[11\]。

## 历史

威尔弗里德·劳雷尔大學的历史溯源于1911的**Waterloo Lutheran Seminary of
Canada**（加拿大滑铁卢[路德宗学院](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/路德宗 "wikilink")），
\[3\]
1914年，该学院发展了很多非[神学领域的课程被更名为](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/神学 "wikilink")
the Waterloo College School， 1924年更名为**Waterloo College of
Arts**，并提供三年制的学士学位课程。 \[4\] 1925年，**Waterloo College of
Arts** 成为[西安大略大学的附属学院](../Page/西安大略大学.md "wikilink")。

Laurier's school colours of purple and gold originated in 1927: maroon
and gold were the colours of Waterloo College, but to honour the link
with the University of Western Ontario, whose colours were purple and
white, maroon was discarded in favour of purple.

The Waterloo College Chapel features several stained glass windows
including \`Light of the world\` (1941) and \`Christ in the garden\`
(1940) by Robert McCausland Limited.

[滑铁卢大学的歷史可追溯到](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/滑铁卢大学 "wikilink")1957年7月1日成立的[滑鐵盧專科聯合學院](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/滑鐵盧專科聯合學院 "wikilink")(Waterloo
College Associate
Faculties)，是當時的[滑鐵盧學院](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/滑鐵盧學院 "wikilink")（即現在的[威尔弗里德·劳雷尔大學](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/威尔弗里德·劳雷尔大學 "wikilink")）的一個半自治部門機構。該機構於1959年正式脫離滑鐵盧學院並升格為大學。

1960年加拿大[路德宗教会结束了对](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/路德宗 "wikilink")[滑鐵盧學院](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/滑鐵盧學院 "wikilink")（Waterloo
College）的资助，同时更名为**Waterloo Lutheran
University**，同时该学院也不再是[西安大略大学的附属学院](../Page/西安大略大学.md "wikilink")。
\[5\]

Wilfrid Laurier University was established by Wilfrid Laurier University
Act 1973, which was amended in 2001.\[6\]

Laurier opened a second campus, in Brantford, Ontario, in 1999, and in
2006 the Lyle S. Hallman Faculty of Social Work moved from the Waterloo
campus to a campus in downtown Kitchener. The Brantford campus is
centred on a number of historic properties in the downtown area which
have been restored for university use. They include a former [Carnegie
library](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_library "wikilink"),
Brantford's 1880 post office, and 1870 mansion, and a 1950 Odeon
Theatre. The Kitchener campus is located in the historic and fully
renovated former St. Jerome's high school building.

In October 2008, the University was named one of [Waterloo Area's Top
Employers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_Area's_Top_Employers "wikilink")
and featured in the [Waterloo Region
Record](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_Region_Record "wikilink")
and [Guelph
Mercury](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guelph_Mercury "wikilink")
newspapers.\[7\]

[Waterloo Lutheran
Seminary](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_Lutheran_Seminary "wikilink")
continues to operate in affiliation with the University and the
[Evangelical Lutheran Church in
Canada](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_Canada "wikilink").

### 校名

滑鐵盧路德宗大學（Waterloo Lutheran University）在轉型為公立大學之時需要去除原校名中的宗教涵義。包括Beaver
University、Riel University、the Iroquois University of
Waterloo在內，一共有多達94個候選名稱。新校名最終於1973年被確定為威爾弗里德·勞雷爾大學（Wilfrid
Laurier University）。有爭議的是彼時一些學生抗議稱Wilfrid
Laurier實為一值得商榷的政治人物，且無論與學校還是滑鐵盧地區皆無任何聯繫。有猜測稱之所以命名為Wilfrid
Laurier University是為了保留學校原有的首字母WLU，以減少更改檔案的麻煩。\[8\]

### Book publishing

The [Wilfrid Laurier University
Press](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfrid_Laurier_University_Press "wikilink"),
which was founded in 1974, deals with archaeology, military history and
sociology/anthropology.\[9\] Wilfrid Laurier University Press is one of
only 8 university publishers found in Canada.

## 学术

The University is home to 14,116 full-time and part-time undergraduate
students, 781 full-time and part-time graduate students and over 500 in
faculty and staff,\[10\] although comparatively small, the university
has consistently ranked among Canada's top schools in its category, an
honour which is regularly confirmed by
[Maclean's](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maclean's "wikilink")
magazine's annual rankings. The 2008 Macleans rankings placed Laurier
fifth overall (first in Ontario) of the 21 Canadian universities in the
category of "Primarily Undergraduate" universities.\[11\]

[Wlu_1.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wlu_1.jpg "fig:Wlu_1.jpg")

In 2008, for undergrad programs, the minimum entering average was 80.3%
for the arts, 80.8% for science, and 86.3% for business.\[12\]

The internationally renowned Faculty of Music at Laurier is considered
one of the best in the country, with programs in performance, music
education, composition, music history, church music, theory and music
therapy. In addition, Laurier is home to the Penderecki String Quartet -
an internationally recognised group playing largely new compositions.
The music faculty boasts two performance spaces - the Theatre Auditorium
and the Maureen Forrester Recital Hall (named after the famous contralto
and former chancellor of WLU). The faculty also attracts a greater
percentage of students from outside Ontario than any other faculty at
Laurier. Laurier's Music program boasts the only Masters Degree in Music
Therapy. Laurier's strength in "music and business education" is touted
as one of the reasons that Waterloo Region is a "powerful educational
hub" by former University of Waterloo president, and now
Governor-General of Canada, [David
Johnston](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Johnston "wikilink").

The university is also home to the Laurier Institute for the Study of
Public Opinion and Policy, the Laurier Centre for Military, Strategic
and Disarmament Studies, the Cold Regions Research Centre, and several
other research centres.

Laurier is the current headquarters of the [Academic Council of the
United Nations
System](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_Council_of_the_United_Nations_System "wikilink")
(ACUNS) which was previously hosted by Yale, Brown and Dartmouth. The
ACUNS goal is to strengthen the study of international organizations and
to create strong ties between the academic community and diplomats
within international organizations.

Laurier is also a prominent partner in the new Balsillie School of
International Affairs, opened in Uptown Waterloo in 2008. The school
offers three programs: a masters in arts in global governance, a masters
in international public policy and a PHD program in global
governance.\[13\]

### [基秦拿校区](../Page/基秦拿.md "wikilink")

In the Fall of 2006 the Faculty of Social Work (previously on the
Waterloo campus) moved to downtown Kitchener. Located on Duke St. it
moved into the old St. Jerome's High School which was designated a
heritage site by the City of Kitchener. This move allowed the students
to be closer to the community and social service agencies with which
they are partnered. Also in an effort to partner better with the
community and make the building more welcoming, faculty and staff held
such events as the Political Coffee House Series, several all-candidates
debates and the [Expressions of Social Justice
Festival](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressions_of_Social_Justice_Festival "wikilink")

## 体育

The university is represented in [Canadian Interuniversity
Sport](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Interuniversity_Sport "wikilink")
by the [Wilfrid Laurier Golden
Hawks](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfrid_Laurier_Golden_Hawks "wikilink").

The history of the team name (Golden Hawks) dates back to the 1961. For
many years, the Waterloo College teams were called simply the Waterloo
College teams, although sometimes they were called the Purple and Gold
and other times the Waterloons. In 1950, the college's newspaper mused
that a name was needed, and in December 1951 a new name was tested: the
Mules.\[14\]

Subsequently, the hockey team became the Ice Mules and the women's
basketball and volleyball teams were known as the Mulettes.

In 1960, with the shift from college to university status, the
university student newspaper again lobbied for change. At a meeting that
year, somebody suggested Golden Hawks and that was the name adopted. A
headline in the January 16, 1961 issue of the newspaper read "From
'Jackass' to 'Bird of Prey'".\[15\]

On November 13, 2004, the Golden Hawks football team won the [Yates
Cup](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yates_Cup "wikilink") against the
[McMaster
Marauders](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_Marauders "wikilink")
at University Stadium in front of a record crowd of 8,175. It was the
sixth Yates Cup victory for Laurier in its history. The game also ended
McMaster's four-year Ontario championship winning streak. The men's
football team scored a second successive Yates Cup victory in November,
2005, followed by a victory in the [Uteck
Bowl](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uteck_Bowl "wikilink") against
[Acadia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadia_University "wikilink").
The Hawks then defeated the [University of Saskatchewan
Huskies](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Saskatchewan_Huskies "wikilink")
24-23 to win the 2005 [Vanier
Cup](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanier_Cup "wikilink"), their first
since 1991.

Laurier's first female national championship was won in 1992 by the
women's soccer team, which followed that up with their second CIS title
in 1995. The men's soccer team claimed back-to-back national
championships in 2000 & 2001.\[16\]

In 2007 the women's lacrosse team achieved a dynasty status by winning
their fifth OUA [Ontario University
Athletics](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_University_Athletics "wikilink")
gold medal in a row. In February 2008, the women's hockey team claimed
its fifth gold medal in as many years and seventh since 1998. The
women's hockey team won its first CIS national championship in 2005.
Both teams have since won sixth consecutive championships in their
respective sports, furthering their dynasties.

In 2008 both the men's and women's curling teams won the inaugural CIS
Championships and represented Canada in China at the 2009 World
University Games. The women's team repeated as CIS Champion's in 2009 in
Montreal and went on to represent Canada in the Karuizawa International
Curling championships where they claimed first place.\[17\]

### Facilities

The athletic facilities at Wilfrid Laurier University include an
Athletic Complex, a Football Stadium and an outdoor multi-purpose
[fieldturf](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/fieldturf "wikilink") field.
The Athletic Complex houses 3 Gyms, 2 Squash Courts, an [Olympic-size
swimming
pool](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic-size_swimming_pool "wikilink"),
a Rock Climbing Wall, and Aerobics/Weight Rooms. University Stadium
includes a
[fieldturf](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/fieldturf "wikilink") football
field and a large indoor gymnasium.\[18\] The swimming pool underwent a
$2 million renovation in 2009/2010.\[19\] In 2007, University Stadium
underwent a $5 Million renovation.\[20\]

students are automatically members of the Students' Union. Their mission
is to enhance the holistic student experience at Wilfrid University by

## 传记

据色诺芬记载, 小居鲁士出生在他父亲登基\[3\]之后。 他有一个哥哥, Arsicas (登基之后改稱「亞他薛西斯二世」),
以及2个名叫Ostanes和Oxathres的弟弟。关于居鲁士的幼年
[普鲁塔克写道](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/普鲁塔克 "wikilink")：「居鲁士自幼就展现了刚愎自用和暴躁的性格；亞他薛西斯则是另一面，任何事情上都显得很优雅,
能屈能伸。」\[4\] 色诺芬对童年时期的居鲁士有更高的评价\[5\]\[6\]。

公元前408年, 在[阿尔西比亚德斯胜利之后](../Page/阿尔西比亚德斯.md "wikilink"),
大流士二世决定继续和[雅典的战争并且给予斯巴达人强有力的支持](../Page/雅典.md "wikilink")。他命小居鲁士去[小亚细亚作为](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/小亚细亚 "wikilink")[吕底亚和](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/吕底亚 "wikilink")[弗里几亚](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/弗里几亚 "wikilink")[总督主要在](../Page/总督.md "wikilink")[卡帕多细亚](../Page/卡帕多细亚.md "wikilink")，成为那边波斯军队的统帅,
"小亚细亚地区的军队聚集在Castolos旷野"。 这里,居鲁士会见了斯巴达将领吕山德。 在他身上,居鲁士发现这个男人愿意支持自己成为王,
就像吕山德希望在波斯王子的支持下成为希腊的绝对统治者。因此，居鲁士全力支持[伯罗奔尼撒战争中的吕山德](../Page/伯罗奔尼撒战争.md "wikilink"),可是拒绝他的继任者[卡利克拉提达斯](../Page/卡利克拉提达斯.md "wikilink").

在那期间, 大流士病倒了，临终前把他的孩子叫到自己身边；\[7\]
居鲁士把钱给了吕山德然后去了[苏萨](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/苏萨 "wikilink").\[8\]
普鲁塔克写道居鲁士的妈妈[帕瑞萨娣丝希望把她心爱的儿子扶上王位](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/帕瑞萨娣丝 "wikilink"),
"因此, 他的父亲大流士现在病了，他被从海上送到了宫庭，从那里出发，满怀希望地说，他将被宣布为王国的继承人。 For Parysatis had
the specious plea in his behalf, which Xerxes on the advice of Demaratus
had of old made use of, that she had borne him Arsicas when he was a
subject, but Cyrus when a king.尽管, 她并不是站在大流士一方, 可是长子Arsicas已经被宣布为王,
改名亞他薛西斯；并且居鲁士保留了吕底亚总督和沿海各省的指挥官的职位。"\[9\]

大流士死后不久，前404年在亞他薛西斯二世登基期间，
[替萨斐尼](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/替萨斐尼 "wikilink")
(Ciθrafarna) 指责居鲁士想要暗杀他的兄弟, 然后居鲁士被逮捕了,
可是在[帕瑞萨娣丝的乞求下](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/帕瑞萨娣丝 "wikilink"),居鲁士被赦免并送回了他的总督区。
根据普鲁塔克所记,他的这次被捕的怨恨使得他比以前更迫切渴望得到这个国家\[10\]

吕山德赢得了[伊哥斯波塔米戰役](../Page/伊哥斯波塔米戰役.md "wikilink"),
之后斯巴达在希腊世界里变的更有影响力了。居鲁士计划扩充军队在同总督[卡里亚](../Page/卡里亚.md "wikilink")[提萨斐尼争执之后](../Page/提萨斐尼.md "wikilink")
, about the [Ionian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionia "wikilink")

前401年春, Cyrus united all his forces into an army now including
Xenophon's "[Ten
Thousand](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Thousand_\(Greek\) "wikilink")",
and advanced from
[Sardis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardis "wikilink") without
announcing the object of his expedition. By dexterous management and
large promises, he overcame the misgivings of the Greek troops over the
length and danger of the war; a Spartan fleet of thirty-five
[triremes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/trireme "wikilink") sent to
[Cilicia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilicia "wikilink") opened the
passes of the [Amanus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanus "wikilink")
into [Syria](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "wikilink") and
conveyed to him a Spartan detachment of 700 men under Cheirisophus. The
king had only been warned at the last moment by Tissaphernes and
gathered an army in haste; Cyrus advanced into Babylonia before he met
with an enemy. In October 401 BC, the [battle of
Cunaxa](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_Cunaxa "wikilink")
ensued. Cyrus had 10,400 Greek
[hoplites](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/hoplite "wikilink")
(citizen-soldiers), 2,500
[peltasts](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/peltast "wikilink") (light
infantry), and an Asiatic army of approximately 10,000 under the command
of [Ariaeus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariaeus "wikilink").

居鲁士看到结果依赖于王的命运; he therefore wanted
[Clearchus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearchus_of_Sparta "wikilink"),
希腊人的统帅， to take the centre against Artaxerxes. Clearchus, out of
arrogance, disobeyed. As a result, the left wing of the Persians under
Tissaphernes was free to engage the rest of Cyrus' forces; Cyrus in the
centre threw himself upon Artaxerxes but was slain. Tissaphernes claimed
to have killed the rebel himself, and Parysatis later took vengeance
upon the slayer of her favorite son. The Persian troops, instead of
attacking the Greeks via a direct assault, decoyed them into the
interior, beyond the
[Tigris](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigris "wikilink"), and then
attacked through trickery. It was a solid and clever plan, but after
their commanders had been taken prisoners, the Greeks managed to force
their way to the [Black
Sea](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea "wikilink").

[Persian_Empire,_490_BC.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Persian_Empire,_490_BC.png "fig:Persian_Empire,_490_BC.png")\]\]

色诺芬写道那些认识居鲁士的人都认为居鲁士是自居鲁士大帝以来最具有王的品质的人并对他有极大的赞扬\[11\]

根据色诺芬的说法, 他的正直给他赢得了很多追随者的忠诚和爱戴\[12\]

## 普鲁塔克对居鲁士死亡的描写

According to the chapter on Artaxerxes II in
*[Plutarch](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "wikilink")'s Life,*
a young Persian soldier named
[Mithridates](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_\(soldier\) "wikilink")
unknowingly struck Cyrus the Younger during the [Battle of
Cunaxa](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cunaxa "wikilink")
([Greek](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "wikilink"):
Κούναξα), making him fall from his horse, 昏倒.
一些阉人发现了居鲁士并尝试把他带到安全的地方, but a
Caunian among the king's camp followers struck a vein behind his knee
with a dart, making him fall and strike his head on a stone, 于是他死了。
Unwisely, Mithridates boasted of killing Cyrus in the court, and
Parysatis had him executed by
[scaphism](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/scaphism "wikilink"). She
likewise got vengeance on Masabates, the king's eunuch, who had cut off
Cyrus' hand and head, by winning him from her son Artaxerxes in a game
of dice and having him flayed alive.\[13\]

5.  In this courtly training Cyrus earned a double reputation; first he
    was held to be a paragon of modesty among his fellows, rendering an
    obedience to his elders which exceeded that of many of his own
    inferiors; and next he bore away the palm for skill in horsemanship
    and for love of the animal itself. Nor less in matters of war, in
    the use of the bow and the javelin, was he held by men in general to
    be at once the aptest of learners and the most eager practiser. As
    soon as his age permitted, the same pre-eminence showed itself in
    his fondness for the chase, not without a certain appetite for
    perilous adventure in facing the wild beasts themselves. Once a bear
    made a furious rush at him, and without wincing he grappled with
    her, and was pulled from his horse, receiving wounds the scars of
    which were visible through life; but in the end he slew the
    creature, nor did he forget him who first came to his aid, but made
    him enviable in the eyes of many.

11. After he had been sent down by his father to be satrap of Lydia and
    Great Phrygia and Cappadocia, and had been appointed general of the
    forces, whose business it is to muster in the plain of the Castolus,
    nothing was more noticeable in his conduct than the importance which
    he attached to the faithful fulfillment of every treaty or compact
    or undertaking entered into with others. He would tell no lies to
    any one. Thus doubtless it was that he won the confidence alike of
    individuals and of the communities entrusted to his care; or in case
    of hostility, a treaty made with Cyrus was a guarantee sufficient to
    the combatant that he would suffer nothing contrary to its terms.
    Therefore, in the war with Tissaphernes, all the states of their own
    accord chose Cyrus in lieu of Tissaphernes, except only the men of
    Miletus, and these were only alienated through fear of him, because
    he refused to abandon their exiled citizens; and his deeds and words
    bore emphatic witness to his principle: even if they were weakened
    in number or in fortune, he would never abandon those who had once
    become his friends.He made no secret of his endeavour to outdo his
    friends and his foes alike in reciprocity of conduct. The prayer has
    been attributed to him, "God grant I may live along enough to
    recompense my friends and requite my foes with a strong arm."

12. Many were the gifts bestowed on him, for many and diverse reasons;
    no one man, perhaps, ever received more; no one, certainly, was ever
    more ready to bestow them upon others, with an eye ever to the taste
    of each, so as to gratify what he saw to be the individual
    requirement. Many of these presents were sent to him to serve as
    personal adornments of the body or for battle; and as touching these
    he would say, "How am I to deck myself out in all these? To my mind
    a man's chief ornament is the adornment of nobly-adorned friends."
    Indeed, that he should triumph over his friends in the great matters
    of welldoing is not surprising, seeing that he was much more
    powerful than they, but that he should go beyond them in minute
    attentions, and in an eager desire to give pleasure, seems to me, I
    must confess, more admirable. Frequently when he had tasted some
    specially excellent wine, he would send the half remaining flagon to
    some friend with a message to say: "Cyrus says, this is the best
    wine he has tasted for a long time, that is his excuse for sending
    it to you. He hopes you will drink it up to-day with a choice party
    of friends." Or, perhaps, he would send the remainder of a dish of
    geese, half loaves of bread, and so forth, the bearer being
    instructed to say: "This is Cyrus's favourite dish, he hopes you
    will taste it yourself." Or, perhaps, there was a great dearth of
    provender, when, through the number of his servants and his own
    careful forethought, he was enabled to get supplies for himself; at
    such times he would send to his friends in different parts, bidding
    them feed their horses on his hay, since it would not do for the
    horses that carried his friends to go starving. Then, on any long
    march or expedition, where the crowd of lookers-on would be large,
    he would call his friends to him and entertain them with serious
    talk, as much as to say, "These I delight to honour."

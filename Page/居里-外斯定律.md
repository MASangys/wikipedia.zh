**居禮-外斯定律**為[居里定律的修正公式](../Page/居里定律.md "wikilink")，用來補足該公式的不足。當一物質的溫度大於[居禮溫度](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/居禮溫度 "wikilink")(\(T_{c}\))時，其磁化率\(\chi\)與溫度\(T\)的關係式為：

\[\chi = \frac{C}{T - T_{c}}\] 其中：

\[C\]是該物質的居禮常數

\[T\]是絕對溫度，單位為\(K\)

\[T_{c}\]是該物質的居禮溫度，單位為\(K\)

根據該定律，當\(T=T_{c}\)時，[磁化率為無窮大](../Page/磁化率.md "wikilink")。而當低於此溫度時，鐵磁性物質將會[自發磁化](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/自發磁化 "wikilink")。

## 基本概念

一個磁性物質的[磁化向量](../Page/磁化強度.md "wikilink")(或稱磁化強度)代表單位體積該物質的磁矩強度。而磁矩可能由原子內的電子運動或者是[自旋所產生](../Page/自旋.md "wikilink")。而淨磁化向量可能由外加磁場誘導產生，甚至可能不需要施加外加磁場也能產生磁化向量(例如足夠低溫狀態下的鐵)，其中後者被稱之為[自發磁化](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/自發磁化 "wikilink")。
而其他與鐵擁有同樣性質的物質，如[鎳與](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/鎳 "wikilink")[磁鐵礦](../Page/磁鐵礦.md "wikilink")，被稱之為[鐵磁性物質](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/鐵磁性 "wikilink")。鐵磁性物質在足夠低的溫度下將會不須施加外部磁場也會產生磁性，而該臨界溫度稱之為[居禮溫度](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/居禮溫度 "wikilink")。

## 局限性

有许多材料的磁化特性在居里点附近显现出明显的敏感性，而由于居里-韦斯定律基于[平均场近似而无法描述这种现象](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/平均场理论 "wikilink")。

In many materials the Curie–Weiss law fails to describe the
susceptibility in the immediate vicinity of the Curie point, since it is
based on a [mean-field
approximation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/mean_field_theory "wikilink").
Instead, there is a [critical
behavior](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/critical_behavior "wikilink") of
the form

\[\chi \sim \frac{1}{(T - T_{c})^\gamma}\]

with the [critical
exponent](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/critical_exponent "wikilink") .
However, at temperatures  the expression of the Curie–Weiss law still
holds true, but with  replaced by a temperature  that is somewhat higher
than the actual Curie temperature. Some authors call  the **Weiss
constant** to distinguish it from the temperature of the actual Curie
point.

## Classical approaches to magnetic susceptibility and Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem

According to [Bohr–van Leeuwen
theorem](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr–van_Leeuwen_theorem "wikilink")
when statistical mechanics and classical mechanics are applied
consistently, the thermal average of the magnetization is always zero.
Magnetism cannot be explained without quantum mechanics. However we list
some classical approaches to it as they are easy to understand and
relate to even though they are incorrect.

The magnetic moment of a free atom is due to the orbital angular
momentum and spin of its electrons and nucleus. When the atoms are such
that their shells are completely filled they do not have any net
magnetic dipole moment in the absence of external magnetic field. When
present, such field distorts the trajectories (classical concept) of the
electrons so that the applied field could be opposed as predicted by the
[Lenz's law](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz's_law "wikilink"). In
other words the net magnetic dipole induced by the external field is in
the opposite direction and such materials are repelled by it. These are
called
[diamagnetic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/diamagnetic "wikilink")
materials.

Sometimes an atom has a net magnetic dipole moment even in the absence
of an external magnetic field. The contributions of the individual
electrons and nucleus to the total angular momentum do not cancel each
other. This happens when the shells of the atoms are not fully filled up
([Hund's Rule](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hund's_Rule "wikilink")). A
collection of such atoms however may not have any net magnetic moment as
these dipoles are not aligned. An external magnetic field may serve to
align them to some extent and develop a net magnetic moment per volume.
Such alignment is temperature dependent as thermal agitation acts to
disorient the dipoles. Such materials are called
[paramagnetic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/paramagnetic "wikilink").

In some materials, the atoms (with net magnetic dipole moments) can
interact with each other to align themselves even in the absence of any
external magnetic field when the thermal agitation is low enough.
Alignment could be parallel
([ferromagnetism](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferromagnetism "wikilink"))
or anti-parallel. In case of anti-parallel, the dipole moments may or
may not cancel each other
([antiferromagnetism](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/antiferromagnetism "wikilink"),
[ferrimagnetism](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferrimagnetism "wikilink")).

## Density matrix approach to magnetic susceptibility

We take a very simple situation in which each atom can be approximated
as a two state system. The thermal energy is so low that the atom is in
ground state. In this ground state the atom is assumed to have no net
orbital angular momentum but only one unpaired electron to give it a
spin of half. In the presence of an external magnetic field the ground
state will split into two states having energy difference proportional
to the applied field. The spin of the unpaired electron is parallel to
the field in the higher energy state and anti-parallel in the lower one.

A [density
matrix](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/density_matrix "wikilink"),
\(\rho\), is a matrix that describes a quantum system in a mixed state,
a statistical ensemble of several quantum states (here several similar
2-state atoms). This should be contrasted with a single state vector
that describes a quantum system in a pure state. The expectation value
of a measurement, \(A\), over the ensemble is
\(\langle A \rangle = Tr (A \rho)\). In terms of a complete set of
states, \(|i\rangle\), one can write

  -
    <math>

\\rho = \\sum_{ij} \\rho_{ij} |i\\rangle \\langle j| . </math>

Von Neumann’s equation tells us how the density matrix evolves with
time.

  -
    <math>

i \\hbar \\frac d {dt} \\rho (t) = \[H, \\rho(t)\] </math>

In equilibrium, one has \([H, \rho] = 0\), and the allowed density
matrices are \(f(H)\). The canonical ensemble has
\(\rho = \exp(-H/T)/Z\) where \(Z = Tr \exp(-H/T)\).

For the 2-state system, we can write \(H = -\gamma \hbar B \sigma_3\).
Here \(\gamma\) is the [gyromagnetic
ratio](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/gyromagnetic_ratio "wikilink").
Hence \(Z = 2 \cosh(\gamma \hbar B/(2T))\), and

\[\rho(B,T) = \frac 1 {2 \cosh(\gamma \hbar B/(2T))}
\begin{pmatrix}
\exp (-\gamma \hbar B/(2T)) & 0 \\
0 & \exp (\gamma \hbar B/(2T))
\end{pmatrix}.\]

From which

\[\langle J_x \rangle =
\langle J_y \rangle = 0,
\langle J_z \rangle = - \frac \hbar 2 \tanh (\gamma \hbar B/(2T)).\]

## Explanation of para and diamagnetism using perturbation theory

In the presence of a uniform external magnetic field \(B\) along the
z-direction, the Hamiltonian of the atom changes by

\[\Delta H = \alpha J_z B + \beta B^2 \sum_i (x_i^2 + y_i^2 ),\] where
\(\alpha, \beta\) are positive real numbers which are independent of
which atom we are looking at but depends on the mass and the charge of
the electron. \(i\) corresponds to individual electrons of the atom.

We apply second order [perturbation
theory](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/perturbation_theory "wikilink") to
this situation. This is justified by the fact that even for highest
presently attainable field strengths, the shifts in the energy level due
to \(\Delta H\) is quite small w.r.t. atomic excitation energies.
Degeneracy of the original Hamiltonian is handled by choosing a basis
which diagonalizes \(\Delta H\) in the degenerate subspaces. Let
\(|n\rangle\) be such a basis for the state of the atom (rather the
electrons in the atom). Let \(\Delta E_n\) be the change in energy in
\(|n \rangle\). So we get

\[\Delta E_n = \langle n | \Delta H | n \rangle + \sum_{m, E_m \neq E_n}
\frac
{| \langle n | \Delta H | m \rangle |^2}
{E_n - E_m}
.\] In our case we can ignore \(B^3\) and higher order terms. We get

\[\Delta E_n = \alpha B \langle n | J_z | n \rangle
+
\alpha^2 B^2 \sum_{m, E_m \neq E_n}
\frac
{| \langle n | J_z | m \rangle |^2}
{E_n - E_m}
+
\beta
B^2 \sum_i \langle n | x_i^2 + y_i^2 | n \rangle
.\]

In case of diamagnetic material, the first two terms are absent as they
don't have any angular momentum in their ground state. In case of
paramagnetic material all the three terms contribute.

## Adding spin-spin interaction in the Hamiltonian: Ising model

So far we have assumed that the atoms do not interact with each other.
Even though this is a reasonable assumption in case of diamagnetic and
paramagnetic substances, this assumption fails in case of ferromagnetism
where the spins of the atom try to align with each other to the extent
permitted by the thermal agitation. In this case we have to consider the
Hamiltonian of the ensemble of the atom. Such a Hamiltonian will contain
all the terms described above for individual atoms and terms
corresponding to the interaction among the pairs of atom. [Ising
model](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model "wikilink") is one of
the simplest approximation of such pairwise interaction.

\[H_{\text{pairs}} =
- \frac 1 2
\sum_{R,R'}
S(R) \cdot S(R') J (R - R')\]

Here the two atoms of a pair are at \(R, R'\). Their interaction \(J\)
is determined by their distance vector \(R - R'\). In order to simplify
calculation it is often assumed that interaction happens between
neighboring atoms only and \(J\) is a constant. The effect of such
interaction is often approximated as a [mean
field](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/mean_field "wikilink") and in our
case the [Weiss
field](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weiss_field "wikilink").

## Modification of Curie Law due to Weiss field

The Curie-Weiss Law is an adapted version of Curie's Law, which for a
paramagnetic material may be written in SI units as\[1\]

\[\chi = \frac{M}{H} =\frac{M \mu_0}{B} =\frac{C}{T} .\]

Here µ<sub>0</sub> is the [permeability of free
space](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/permeability_of_free_space "wikilink");
*M* the
[magnetization](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/magnetization "wikilink")
([magnetic
moment](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/magnetic_moment "wikilink") per
unit volume), *µ*<sub>0</sub>*H*}} is the [magnetic
field](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/magnetic_field "wikilink"), and *C*
the material-specific [Curie
constant](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_constant "wikilink"):

\[C = \frac{\mu_0 \mu_B^2}{3 k_B}N g^2 J(J+1),\] where  is [Boltzmann's
constant](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann's_constant "wikilink"),
 the number of magnetic atoms (or molecules) per unit volume,  the
[Landé
g-factor](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landé_g-factor "wikilink"),
the [Bohr
magneton](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_magneton "wikilink"),  the
[angular
momentum](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/angular_momentum "wikilink")
quantum number.\[2\]

For the Curie-Weiss Law the total magnetic field is  where  is the Weiss
molecular field constant and then

\[\chi =\frac{M \mu_0}{B}\] →
\(\frac{M \mu_0}{B+\lambda M} =\frac{C}{T}\)

which can be rearranged to get

\[\chi = \frac{C}{T - \frac{C \lambda }{\mu_0}}\]

which is the Curie-Weiss Law

\[\chi = \frac{C}{T - T_{c}}\] where the [Curie
Temperature](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_Temperature "wikilink")
 is

\[T_C = \frac{C \lambda }{\mu_0}\]

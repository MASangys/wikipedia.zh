《**帶我去看棒球賽**》（*Take Me Out to the Ball Game*）是20世紀初[美國](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美國 "wikilink")[紐約](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/紐約 "wikilink")[叮砰巷創作出的歌曲](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/叮砰巷 "wikilink")，儘管作曲作詞者從未在現場看過球賽，但这首歌卻受到相當大地迴響成了非官方的棒球國歌。傳統上，球場會在第七局的伸展活動中播放這首歌，而球迷也會跟著旋律合唱。

## 歌曲歷史

這首歌的歌詞是由[Jack Norworth撰寫](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Norworth "wikilink")，除此以外他還寫了另一首知名作品〈*Shine On, Harvest Moon*〉。某日Jack Norworth搭乘地鐵看到窗外公車廣告板上寫著「今日球賽-[馬球球場](../Page/舊金山巨人.md "wikilink")」的廣告詞，突然啟發了他的靈感寫下了這首歌的歌詞，然後交由[Albert Von Tilzer負責譜曲](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Von_Tilzer "wikilink")，儘管兩人過去從未在現場看過球賽。

**1908年版本**
Katie Casey was baseball mad,
Had the fever and had it bad.
Just to root for the home town crew,
Ev'ry sou
Katie blew.
On a Saturday her young beau
Called to see if she'd like to go
To see a show
But Miss Kate said "No,
I'll tell you what you can do:"

**1927年版本**
Nelly Kelly loved baseball games,
Knew the players, knew all their names.
You could see her there ev'ry day,
Shout "Hurray"
When they'd play.
Her boyfriend by the name of Joe
Said, "To Coney Isle, dear, let's go",
Then Nelly started to fret and pout,
And to him, I heard her shout:

Take me out to the ball game,
Take me out with the crowd;
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks,
I don't care if I never get back.
Let me root, root, root for the home team,
If they don't win, it's a shame.
For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out,
At the old ball game.

Katie Casey saw all the games,
Knew the players by their first names.
Told the umpire he was wrong,
All along,
Good and strong.
When the score was just two to two,
Katie Casey knew what to do,
Just to cheer up the boys she knew,
She made the gang sing this song:

Nelly Kelly was sure some fan,
She would root just like any man,
Told the umpire he was wrong,
All along,
Good and strong.
When the score was just two to two,
Nelly Kelly knew what to do,
Just to cheer up the boys she knew,
She made the gang sing this song:

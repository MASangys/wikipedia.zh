**Bradycardia** is a condition wherein an individual has a slow [heart
rate](../Page/heart_rate.md "wikilink"), typically defined as a [heart
rate](../Page/heart_rate.md "wikilink") of under 60 [beats per
minute](../Page/Heart_rate.md "wikilink") (BPM) in adults.\[1\]
Bradycardia typically does not cause symptoms until the rate drops below
50 BPM. When symptomatic, it may cause fatigue, weakness, dizziness,
sweating, and at very low rates,
[fainting](../Page/Syncope_\(medicine\).md "wikilink").\[2\]

During sleep, a slow heartbeat with rates around 40–50 BPM is common,
and is considered normal. Highly trained
[athletes](../Page/sportsperson.md "wikilink") may also have [athletic
heart syndrome](../Page/athletic_heart_syndrome.md "wikilink"), a very
slow resting heart rate that occurs as a sport adaptation and helps
prevent [tachycardia](../Page/tachycardia.md "wikilink") during
training.

The term relative bradycardia is used in explaining a heart rate that,
although not actually below 60 BPM, is still considered too slow for the
individual's current medical condition.

**心跳过慢**（Bradycardia）也称**心动过缓**、**心跳过缓**、**心动徐缓**、**徐脉**。是指心脏跳动速度低于正常水平，达到每分钟50次以下的现象。心跳过慢可能是由迷走神经亢奋、[窦房结病变](../Page/窦房结.md "wikilink")、窦房结的冲动波遭到阻挡等原因引起，常见于老年人、[心脏病患者](../Page/心脏病.md "wikilink")\[3\]

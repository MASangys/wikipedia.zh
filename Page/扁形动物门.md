**扁形动物门**（學名：；語源： *platy* 扁平 +  *helminth-*
蟲\[1\]）是[动物界的一个门](../Page/动物.md "wikilink")，[無脊椎動物](../Page/無脊椎動物.md "wikilink")，是一类簡單的無環節[两侧对称动物](../Page/两侧对称动物.md "wikilink")，有三胚层，无[体腔](../Page/体腔.md "wikilink")，無呼吸系統、無循環系統，有口无肛门的动物。所以必須保持身體扁平，以使[氧氣及](../Page/氧氣.md "wikilink")[養料能夠透過](../Page/養料.md "wikilink")[滲透來吸收](../Page/滲透.md "wikilink")。消化腔只有一個開口，同時用於進食及排泄；所以食物在其體內無法有效處理。

已记录的扁形动物约有15000种。生活於淡水、海水等潮溼處，體前端有兩個可感光的色素點。體表部分或全部分布有纖毛。

傳統的醫學文獻會將扁形動物劃分為非[寄生的](../Page/寄生蟲.md "wikilink")[渦蟲綱](../Page/渦蟲綱.md "wikilink")（例如：[真渦蟲科的物種](../Page/真渦蟲科.md "wikilink")）和三個會寄生的物種的綱：[絛蟲綱](../Page/絛蟲綱.md "wikilink")、[吸蟲綱及](../Page/吸蟲綱.md "wikilink")[單殖綱](../Page/單殖綱.md "wikilink")。然而，由於渦蟲綱已證實並非[單系群](../Page/單系群.md "wikilink")，這種劃分方式在動物學來看已經過時。
非寄生的扁蟲都是捕食者，棲息於水中或遮蔭的陸上潮濕環境，例如：[落葉堆](../Page/落葉堆.md "wikilink")。絛蟲和吸蟲的生命週期比較複雜：牠們的成熟階段會以寄生蟲的形式居住在魚類或陸上[脊椎動物的消化系統裡](../Page/脊椎動物.md "wikilink")；而[中間宿主階段會尋找可被感染的中間宿主](../Page/中間宿主.md "wikilink")。吸虫的卵从最终宿主体内排出，而成年绦虫会产生大量[雌雄同体的](../Page/雌雄同体.md "wikilink")[节片](../Page/节片.md "wikilink")，在成熟后会分离，排出宿主，再释放卵。与其他寄生的类群不同，[单殖纲是水生生物的体外寄生虫](../Page/单殖纲.md "wikilink")，其幼虫在附着于合适宿主厚变态为成虫。

因为扁形动物没有体腔，它们曾被认为是最原始的两侧对称动物（有两侧对称，有头尾之分的动物）。但是，在1980年代中期以来的研究发现原来被分类为扁形动物的一个群体，[无腔动物门](../Page/无腔动物门.md "wikilink")，离最初的两侧对称动物较任何其他现代类群更近。除去无腔动物后的扁形动物门是一个[单系群](../Page/单系群.md "wikilink")，即是有一个共同祖先及其所有后裔组成的。扁形动物门属于[冠轮动物](../Page/冠轮动物.md "wikilink")，是较复杂的两侧对称动物的三个进化支之一。這些分析顯示出已重新定義，不包含無腔動物門的扁形動物門，是由兩個單系群，Catenulida
和 Rhabitophora 所組成的 ,
而絛蟲綱、吸蟲綱和單殖綱組成Rhabitophora的一個分支底下的單系群。因此，傳統上認定的渦蟲綱現在被認為是旁系群，因為其不包含從傳統渦蟲綱分支出去的寄生性物種之類群。

超过一半已知的扁形动物属于 [寄生虫](../Page/寄生虫.md "wikilink"),
而且某些物種會對人類以及牲畜造成很大的傷害。[血吸蟲病是由](../Page/血吸虫病.md "wikilink")[吸蟲綱](../Page/吸蟲綱.md "wikilink")[裂體屬的物種所造成的](../Page/血吸虫.md "wikilink")，是所有由寄生蟲造成的人類疾病中第二致命的，僅次於[瘧疾](../Page/疟疾.md "wikilink")。囊蟲腦病變是當豬肉絛蟲的幼體(囊尾幼蟲)侵入[中樞神經系統時產生](../Page/中樞神經系統.md "wikilink"),
是後天獲得之[癲癇的主因之一](../Page/癫痫.md "wikilink")。這些寄生性物種在開發中國家的威脅來自於生食與未完全煮熟之食物受到歡迎，以及從高風險地區的進口。在低度開發的國家中，人們可能無法負擔用以煮熟食物之燃料的費用，再加上設計不良之供水系統以及灌溉工程，使得不良的公共衛生及農業衛生提高被感染之風險。

兩種扁形動物在菲律賓、印尼、夏威夷、新幾內亞和關島被用來控制威脅原生種蝸牛生存的外來種[非洲大蝸牛之族群大小](../Page/非洲大蝸牛.md "wikilink")，並收到良好成效。但是，最近發現這些扁形動物可能自身就會威脅原生種蝸牛的生存。在西北歐地區，以蚯蚓為食的紐西蘭扁蟲(*[Arthurdendyus
triangulatus](../Page/Arthurdendyus_triangulatus.md "wikilink")*)的散播引起各方擔憂。

### Distinguishing features

Platyhelminthes are [bilaterally
symmetrical](../Page/Symmetry_\(biology\)#Bilateral_symmetry.md "wikilink")
[animals](../Page/animal.md "wikilink"): their left and right sides are
mirror images of each other; this also implies they have distinct top
and bottom surfaces and distinct head and tail ends. Like other
[bilaterians](../Page/bilateria.md "wikilink"), they have three main
[cell](../Page/cell_\(biology\).md "wikilink") layers (endoderm,
mesoderm, and ectoderm),\[2\] while the [radially
symmetrical](../Page/Symmetry_\(biology\)#Radial_symmetry.md "wikilink")
[cnidarians](../Page/cnidarian.md "wikilink") and
[ctenophores](../Page/ctenophore.md "wikilink") (comb jellies) have only
two cell layers.\[3\] Beyond that, they are "defined more by what they
do not have than by any particular series of specializations."\[4\]
Unlike other bilaterians, Platyhelminthes have no internal body cavity,
so are described as [acoelomates](../Page/acoelomate.md "wikilink").
They also lack specialized
[circulatory](../Page/circulatory_system.md "wikilink") and
[respiratory](../Page/respiratory_system.md "wikilink") organs, both of
these facts are defining features when classifying a flatworm's
[anatomy](../Page/organ_\(anatomy\).md "wikilink").\[5\]\[6\] Their
bodies are soft and unsegmented.\[7\]

### Features common to all subgroups

The lack of circulatory and respiratory organs limits platyhelminths to
sizes and shapes that enable [oxygen](../Page/oxygen.md "wikilink") to
reach and [carbon dioxide](../Page/carbon_dioxide.md "wikilink") to
leave all parts of their bodies by simple
[diffusion](../Page/diffusion.md "wikilink"). Hence, many are
microscopic and the large species have flat ribbon-like or leaf-like
shapes. The guts of large species have many branches, allowing nutrients
to diffuse to all parts of the body.\[11\] Respiration through the whole
surface of the body makes them vulnerable to fluid loss, and restricts
them to environments where
[dehydration](../Page/dehydration.md "wikilink") is unlikely: sea and
freshwater, moist terrestrial environments such as [leaf
litter](../Page/leaf_litter.md "wikilink") or between grains of soil,
and as [parasites](../Page/parasite.md "wikilink") within other
animals.\[12\]

The space between the skin and gut is filled with
[mesenchyme](../Page/mesenchyme.md "wikilink"), a [connective
tissue](../Page/connective_tissue.md "wikilink") made of
[cells](../Page/cell_\(biology\).md "wikilink") and reinforced by
[collagen](../Page/collagen.md "wikilink") fibers that act as a type of
[skeleton](../Page/skeleton.md "wikilink"), providing attachment points
for [muscles](../Page/muscle.md "wikilink"). The mesenchyme contains all
the internal organs and allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and
waste products. It consists of two main types of cell: fixed cells, some
of which have fluid-filled [vacuoles](../Page/vacuole.md "wikilink");
and [stem cells](../Page/stem_cell.md "wikilink"), which can transform
into any other type of cell, and are used in regenerating tissues after
injury or [asexual
reproduction](../Page/asexual_reproduction.md "wikilink").\[13\]

Most platyhelminths have no [anus](../Page/anus.md "wikilink") and
regurgitate undigested material through the mouth. However, some long
species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts have more than
one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult for
them.\[14\] The gut is lined with a single layer of
[endodermal](../Page/endoderm.md "wikilink") cells that absorb and
digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting
[enzymes](../Page/enzyme.md "wikilink") in the gut or
[pharynx](../Page/pharynx.md "wikilink") (throat).\[15\]

All animals need to keep the
[concentration](../Page/Concentration_\(chemistry\).md "wikilink") of
dissolved substances in their body fluids at a fairly constant level.
Internal parasites and free-living marine animals live in environments
with high concentrations of dissolved material, and generally let their
tissues have the same level of concentration as the environment, while
freshwater animals need to prevent their body fluids from becoming too
dilute. Despite this difference in environments, most platyhelminths use
the same system to [control the
concentration](../Page/osmoregulation.md "wikilink") of their body
fluids. [Flame cells](../Page/Flame_cell.md "wikilink"), so called
because the beating of their [flagella](../Page/flagella.md "wikilink")
looks like a flickering candle flame, extract from the mesenchyme water
that contains wastes and some reusable material, and drive it into
networks of tube cells which are lined with flagella and
[microvilli](../Page/microvilli.md "wikilink"). The tube cells' flagella
drive the water towards exits called
[nephridiopores](../Page/nephridiopore.md "wikilink"), while their
microvilli reabsorb reusable materials and as much water as is needed to
keep the body fluids at the right concentration. These combinations of
flame cells and tube cells are called
[protonephridia](../Page/protonephridia.md "wikilink").\[16\]\[17\]

In all platyhelminths, the [nervous
system](../Page/nervous_system.md "wikilink") is concentrated at the
head end. This is least marked in the
[acoels](../Page/acoel.md "wikilink"), which have [nerve
nets](../Page/nerve_net.md "wikilink") rather like those of
[cnidarians](../Page/cnidaria.md "wikilink") and
[ctenophores](../Page/ctenophore.md "wikilink"), but densest around the
head. Other platyhelminths have rings of
[ganglia](../Page/Ganglion.md "wikilink") in the head and main nerve
trunks running along their bodies.\[18\]\[19\]

## 主要分組

早期分類將扁形動物分為四組，即：渦蟲綱、吸蟲綱、單殖綱及絛蟲綱。這個分類長久以來都被認為是一種人工強行分類，所以Ehlers
(1985)\[20\]提出一個比較符合[支序親緣學觀點的分類](../Page/支序親緣學.md "wikilink")，將渦蟲綱分為12個目，然後再將吸蟲類、單殖類和絛蟲類等寄生蟲組合成一個新的[Neodermata目](../Page/Neodermata.md "wikilink")。可是這個分類仍然主要只為科學文獻採用\[21\]，所以以下我們仍然以傳統分類去介紹扁形動物的分類。

### 渦蟲綱

[Pseudoceros_dimidiatus.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pseudoceros_dimidiatus.jpg "fig:Pseudoceros_dimidiatus.jpg")''\]\]
渦蟲綱包括有物種4500種\[22\]均能自由遷徙，長度從到不等。大多數為掠食者或者是食腐動物。多居住在陰暗潮濕的地方，如落葉底下。
However, some are [symbiotes](../Page/symbiosis.md "wikilink") of other
animals, such as [crustaceans](../Page/crustacea.md "wikilink"), and
some are [parasites](../Page/parasite.md "wikilink"). Free-living
turbellarians are mostly black, brown or gray, but some larger ones are
brightly colored.\[23\] The [Acoela](../Page/Acoela.md "wikilink") and
[Nemertodermatida](../Page/Nemertodermatida.md "wikilink") were
traditionally regarded as turbellarians,\[24\]\[25\] but are now
regarded as members of a separate phylum, the
[Acoelomorpha](../Page/Acoelomorpha.md "wikilink"),\[26\]\[27\] or as
two separate phyla.\[28\]
*[Xenoturbella](../Page/Xenoturbella.md "wikilink")*, a
[genus](../Page/genus.md "wikilink") of very simple animals,\[29\] has
also been reclassified as a separate phylum.\[30\]

Some turbellarians have a simple
[pharynx](../Page/pharynx.md "wikilink") lined with
[cilia](../Page/Cilium.md "wikilink") and generally feed by using cilia
to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are
usually in the middle of their undersides. Most other turbellarians have
a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned
inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along
the underside.\[31\] The freshwater species *[Microstomum
caudatum](../Page/Microstomum_caudatum.md "wikilink")* can open its
mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large
as itself.\[32\]

Most turbellarians have pigment-cup
[ocelli](../Page/ocelli.md "wikilink") ("little eyes"), one pair in most
species, but two or even three pairs in some. A few large species have
many eyes in clusters over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced
uniformly around the edge of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish
the direction from which light is coming and enable the animals to avoid
it. A few groups have [statocysts](../Page/statocyst.md "wikilink"),
fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few
groups, two. These statocysts are thought to be balance and acceleration
sensors, as that is the function they perform in
[cnidarian](../Page/cnidaria.md "wikilink")
[medusae](../Page/medusae.md "wikilink") and in
[ctenophores](../Page/ctenophore.md "wikilink"). However, turbellarian
statocysts have no sensory cilia, and how they sense the movements and
positions of the solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most
have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially
on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves
on the head are probably smell sensors.\[33\]

[Mating_Pseudobiceros_bedfordi.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mating_Pseudobiceros_bedfordi.png "fig:Mating_Pseudobiceros_bedfordi.png")ns
are mating by [penis fencing](../Page/penis_fencing.md "wikilink"). Each
has two penises, the white spikes on the undersides of their heads.\]\]
[Planarians](../Page/Planarian.md "wikilink"), a subgroup of seriates,
are famous for their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across
their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments that do not already
have a head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the
original head. This suggests the growth of a head is controlled by a
chemical whose concentration diminishes from head to tail. Many
turbellarians [clone](../Page/cloning.md "wikilink") themselves by
transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels,
reproduce by [budding](../Page/budding.md "wikilink").\[34\]

The vast majority of turbellarians are
[hermaphrodites](../Page/hermaphrodite.md "wikilink") (have both female
and male reproductive cells), and fertilize eggs
[internally](../Page/internal_fertilization.md "wikilink") by
[copulation](../Page/copulation.md "wikilink").\[35\] Some of the larger
aquatic species mate by [penis
fencing](../Page/penis_fencing.md "wikilink"), a duel in which each
tries to impregnate the other, and the loser adopts the female role of
developing the eggs.\[36\] In most species, "miniature adults" emerge
when the eggs hatch, but a few large species produce
[plankton](../Page/plankton.md "wikilink")-like
[larvae](../Page/larva.md "wikilink").\[37\]

### 吸蟲綱

[Metagonimus_LifeCycle.gif](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Metagonimus_LifeCycle.gif "fig:Metagonimus_LifeCycle.gif")''\]\]
[吸蟲綱的學名](../Page/吸蟲綱.md "wikilink")源自希臘語的，意思就是一個孔洞，refers to the
cavities in their [holdfasts](../Page/holdfast.md "wikilink")\[38\]
which resemble suckers and anchor them within their hosts.\[39\] 。 The
skin of all species is a [syncitium](../Page/syncitium.md "wikilink"), a
layer of cells that shares a single external
[membrane](../Page/Biological_membrane.md "wikilink"). Trematodes are
divided into two groups, Digenea and Aspidogastrea (also known as
Aspodibothrea).\[40\]

#### 複殖亞綱

These are often called flukes, as most have flat
[rhomboid](../Page/rhomboid.md "wikilink") shapes like that of a
[flounder](../Page/flounder.md "wikilink") (Old English *flóc*). There
are about 11,000 species, more than all other platyhelminthes combined,
and second only to [roundworms](../Page/roundworm.md "wikilink") among
parasites on [metazoans](../Page/metazoan.md "wikilink").\[41\] Adults
usually have two holdfasts, a ring around the mouth and a larger sucker
midway along what would be the underside in a free-living
flatworm.\[42\] Although the name "Digeneans" means "two generations",
most have very complex life cycles with up to seven stages, depending on
what combinations of environments the early stages encounter – most
importantly whether the eggs are deposited on land or in water. The
intermediate stages transfer the parasites from one host to another. The
[definitive host](../Page/definitive_host.md "wikilink") in which adults
develop is a land vertebrate, the earliest host of juvenile stages is
usually a snail that may live on land or in water, and in many cases a
fish or arthropod is the second host.\[43\] For example, the adjoining
illustration shows the life cycle of the intestinal fluke
*[metagonimus](../Page/metagonimus.md "wikilink")*, which hatches in the
intestine of a snail; moves to a fish, where it penetrates the body and
encysts in the flesh; then moves to the small intestine of a land animal
that eats the fish raw; and then generates eggs that are excreted and
ingested by snails, thereby completing the cycle. Schistosomes, which
cause the devastating tropical disease
[bilharzia](../Page/bilharzia.md "wikilink"), belong to this
group.\[44\]

Adults range between  and  in length. Individual adult digeneans are of
a single sex, and in some species, slender females live in enclosed
grooves that run along the bodies of the males, and partially emerge to
lay eggs. In all species, the adults have complex reproductive systems
and can produce between 10,000 and 100,000 times as many eggs as a
free-living flatworm. In addition, the intermediate stages that live in
snails reproduce asexually.\[45\]

Adults of different species infest different parts of the definitive
host, for example the [intestine](../Page/intestine.md "wikilink"),
[lungs](../Page/lung.md "wikilink"), large blood vessels,\[46\] and
liver.\[47\] The adults use a relatively large, muscular
[pharynx](../Page/pharynx.md "wikilink") to ingest cells, cell
fragments, [mucus](../Page/mucus.md "wikilink"), body fluids or blood.
In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external
syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can
live without oxygen for long periods.\[48\]

#### Aspidogastrea

Members of this small group have either a single divided sucker or a row
of suckers that cover the underside.\[49\] They infest the guts of
[bony](../Page/teleost.md "wikilink") or
[cartilaginous](../Page/elasmobranch.md "wikilink") fish and of turtles,
and the body cavities of marine and freshwater
[bivalves](../Page/bivalve.md "wikilink") and
[gastropods](../Page/gastropod.md "wikilink").\[50\] Their eggs produce
[ciliated](../Page/cilia.md "wikilink") swimming larvae, and the life
cycle has one or two hosts.\[51\]

### Cercomeromorpha

These parasites attach themselves to their hosts by means of disks that
bear crescent-shaped hooks. They are divided into Monogenea and
Cestoda.\[52\]

#### 單殖綱

[Journal.pone.0079155.g004_Only_silhouettes_of_bodies.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Journal.pone.0079155.g004_Only_silhouettes_of_bodies.png "fig:Journal.pone.0079155.g004_Only_silhouettes_of_bodies.png")n
ns\[53\]\]\]
[單殖綱](../Page/單殖綱.md "wikilink")，舊作[單殖目](../Page/單殖目.md "wikilink")，目前包括約1100個物種，絕大多數都是[外部寄生蟲](../Page/外部寄生蟲.md "wikilink")，需要特定物種作為[中間宿主](../Page/中間宿主.md "wikilink")。體型細小，約2～3
cm長。這些中間宿主以[魚類最為常見](../Page/魚類.md "wikilink")，但有時也可以是[兩棲類或](../Page/兩棲類.md "wikilink")[水生](../Page/水生爬蟲類.md "wikilink")[爬蟲類動物](../Page/爬蟲類.md "wikilink")。少數屬於[內部寄生蟲](../Page/內部寄生蟲.md "wikilink")。單殖綱的成蟲在其後端有大型的附著器官，s
(Greek ἅπτειν, *haptein*, means "catch"), which have , , and hooks. They
often have flattened bodies. In some species, the
[咽](../Page/咽.md "wikilink") secretes enzymes to digest the host's
skin, allowing the parasite to feed on blood and cellular debris. Others
graze externally on mucus and flakes of the hosts' skins.
「單殖綱」這名稱源由於這些寄生蟲的生命週期只有一個[非蚴階段](../Page/非蚴階段.md "wikilink")（Nonlarval
stage）\[54\]。

#### 絛蟲綱

[Taenia_LifeCycle.gif](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Taenia_LifeCycle.gif "fig:Taenia_LifeCycle.gif")物種的生命週期。圖5顯示的是4條[豬帶絛蟲](../Page/豬帶絛蟲.md "wikilink")，在其末端有盤狀倒鉤。圖6顯示的是一整條絛蟲。\]\]
絛蟲有扁瘦但非常長的身體。其學名
“cestode”的字根源於[拉丁語的](../Page/拉丁語.md "wikilink")，意思就是「帶子」。這3400個絛蟲的物種的成蟲都是內部寄生蟲。牠們沒有口部和腸臟，
and the [syncitial](../Page/syncitium.md "wikilink") skin absorbs
nutrients – mainly [carbohydrates](../Page/carbohydrate.md "wikilink")
and [amino acids](../Page/amino_acid.md "wikilink") – from the host, and
also disguises it chemically to avoid attacks by the host's [immune
system](../Page/immune_system.md "wikilink").\[55\] Shortage of
carbohydrates in the host's diet stunts the growth of the parasites and
kills some. Their [metabolisms](../Page/metabolism.md "wikilink")
generally use simple but inefficient chemical processes, and they
compensate by consuming large amounts of food relative to their
size.\[56\]

In the majority of species, known as eucestodes ("true tapeworms"), the
neck produces a chain of segments called proglottids by a process known
as [strobilation](../Page/strobilation.md "wikilink"). Hence, the most
mature proglottids are furthest from the scolex. Adults of *[Taenia
saginata](../Page/Taenia_saginata.md "wikilink")*, which infests humans,
can form proglottid chains over  long, although  is more typical. Each
proglottid has both male and female reproductive organs. If the host's
gut contains two or more adults of the same cestode species, they
generally fertilize each other, but proglottids of the same worm can
fertilize each other and even fertilize themselves. When the eggs are
fully developed, the proglottids separate and are excreted by the host.
The eucestode life cycle is less complex than that of
[digeneans](../Page/digenea.md "wikilink"), but varies depending on the
species. For example:

  - Adults of
    *[Diphyllobothrium](../Page/Diphyllobothrium.md "wikilink")* infest
    fish, and the juveniles use [copepod](../Page/copepod.md "wikilink")
    crustaceans as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids release
    their eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into
    [ciliated](../Page/cilia.md "wikilink"), swimming larvae. If a larva
    is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia and the skin becomes a
    syncitium and the larva makes its way into the copepod's
    [hemocoel](../Page/hemocoel.md "wikilink") (internal cavity that is
    the main part of the [circulatory
    system](../Page/circulatory_system.md "wikilink")) and attached
    itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish,
    the larva [metamorphoses](../Page/metamorphosis.md "wikilink") into
    a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes
    an adult.\[57\]
  - Various species of
    *[Taenia](../Page/Taenia_\(genus\).md "wikilink")* infest the guts
    of humans, cats and dogs. The juveniles use herbivores – for example
    pigs, cattle and rabbits – as intermediate hosts. Excreted
    proglottids release eggs that stick to grass leaves and hatch after
    being swallowed by a herbivore. The larva makes its way to the
    herbivore's muscles and metamorphoses into an oval worm about  long,
    with a scolex that is kept inside. When the definitive host eats
    infested and raw or undercooked meat from an intermediate host, the
    worm's scolex pops out and attaches itself to the gut, and the adult
    tapeworm develops.\[58\]

A members of the smaller group known as
[Cestodaria](../Page/Cestodaria.md "wikilink") have no scolex, do not
produce proglottids, and have body shapes like those of diageneans.
Cestodarians parasitize fish and turtles.\[59\]

The oldest confidently identified parasitic flatworm fossils are
[cestode](../Page/cestode.md "wikilink") eggs found in a
[Permian](../Page/Permian.md "wikilink") shark
[coprolite](../Page/coprolite.md "wikilink"), but helminth hooks still
attached to [Devonian](../Page/Devonian.md "wikilink")
[acanthodians](../Page/acanthodians.md "wikilink") and
[placoderms](../Page/placoderms.md "wikilink") might also represent
parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles.\[64\] The oldest known
free-living platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in
[Eocene](../Page/Eocene.md "wikilink") age [Baltic
amber](../Page/Baltic_amber.md "wikilink") and placed in the monotypic
species *[Micropalaeosoma
balticus](../Page/Micropalaeosoma.md "wikilink")*,\[65\] while the
oldest subfossil specimens are
[schistosome](../Page/Schistosoma.md "wikilink") eggs discovered in
ancient Egyptian [mummies](../Page/Mummy.md "wikilink").\[66\] The
Platyhelminthes have very few
[synapomorphies](../Page/synapomorphy.md "wikilink"), distinguishing
features that all Platyhelminthes and no other animals have. This makes
it difficult to work out both their relationships with other groups of
animals and the relationships between different groups that are
described as members of the Platyhelminthes.\[67\]

The "traditional" view before the 1990s was that Platyhelminthes formed
the [sister group](../Page/sister_group.md "wikilink") to all the other
bilaterians, which include, for example,
[arthropods](../Page/arthropod.md "wikilink"),
[molluscs](../Page/mollusc.md "wikilink"),
[annelids](../Page/annelid.md "wikilink") and
[chordates](../Page/chordate.md "wikilink"). Since then [molecular
phylogenetics](../Page/molecular_phylogenetics.md "wikilink"), which
aims to work out evolutionary "family trees" by comparing different
organisms' [biochemicals](../Page/biochemistry.md "wikilink") such as
[DNA](../Page/DNA.md "wikilink"), [RNA](../Page/RNA.md "wikilink") and
[proteins](../Page/protein.md "wikilink"), has radically changed
scientists' view of evolutionary relationships between animals.\[68\]
Detailed [morphological](../Page/morphology_\(biology\).md "wikilink")
analyses of anatomical features in the mid-1980s and molecular
phylogenetics analyses since 2000 using different sections of DNA agree
that [Acoelomorpha](../Page/Acoelomorpha.md "wikilink"), consisting of
[Acoela](../Page/Acoela.md "wikilink") (traditionally regarded as very
simple "[turbellarians](../Page/turbellaria.md "wikilink")"\[69\]) and
[Nemertodermatida](../Page/Nemertodermatida.md "wikilink") (another
small group previously classified as "turbellarians"\[70\]) are the
sister group to all other bilaterians, including the rest of the
Platyhelminthes.\[71\]\[72\] However, a 2007 study concluded that Acoela
and Nemertodermatida were two distinct groups of bilaterians, although
it agreed that both are more closely related to
[cnidarians](../Page/cnidaria.md "wikilink") (jellyfish, etc.) than
other bilaterians are.\[73\]

*[Xenoturbella](../Page/Xenoturbella.md "wikilink")*, a bilaterian whose
only well-defined organ is a
[statocyst](../Page/statocyst.md "wikilink"), was originally classified
as a "primitive turbellarian".\[74\] However, it has recently been
reclassified as a
[deuterostome](../Page/deuterostome.md "wikilink").\[75\]\[76\]

The Platyhelminthes excluding Acoelomorpha contain two main groups,
[Catenulida](../Page/Catenulida.md "wikilink") and
[Rhabditophora](../Page/Rhabditophora.md "wikilink"), both of which are
generally agreed to be monophyletic (each contains all and only the
descendants of an ancestor that is a member of the same
group).\[77\]\[78\] Early molecular phylogenetics analyses of the
Catenulida and Rhabditophora left uncertainties about whether these
could be combined in a single monophyletic group, but a study in 2008
concluded they could, therefore Platyhelminthes could be redefined as
Catenulida plus Rhabditophora, excluding the Acoelomorpha.\[79\]

Other molecular phylogenetics analyses agree the redefined
Platyhelminthes are most closely related to
[Gastrotricha](../Page/Gastrotricha.md "wikilink"), and both are part of
a grouping known as [Platyzoa](../Page/Platyzoa.md "wikilink"). Platyzoa
are generally agreed to be at least closely related to the
[Lophotrochozoa](../Page/Lophotrochozoa.md "wikilink"), a
super[phylum](../Page/phylum.md "wikilink") that includes molluscs and
[annelid](../Page/annelid.md "wikilink") worms. The majority view is
that Platyzoa are part of Lophotrochozoa, but a significant minority of
researchers regard Platyzoa as a sister group of Lophotrochozoa.\[80\]

It has been agreed since 1985 that each of the wholly parasitic
platyhelminth groups ([Cestoda](../Page/Cestoda.md "wikilink"),
[Monogenea](../Page/Monogenea.md "wikilink") and
[Trematoda](../Page/Trematoda.md "wikilink")) is monophyletic, and that
together these form a larger monophyletic grouping, the
[Neodermata](../Page/Neodermata.md "wikilink"), in which the adults of
all members have [syncitial](../Page/syncitium.md "wikilink")
skins.\[81\] However, there is debate about whether the
[Cestoda](../Page/Cestoda.md "wikilink") and
[Monogenea](../Page/Monogenea.md "wikilink") can be combined as an
intermediate monophyletic group, the
[Cercomeromorpha](../Page/Cercomeromorpha.md "wikilink"), within the
Neodermata.\[82\]\[83\] It is generally agreed that the Neodermata are a
sub-group a few levels down in the "family tree" of the
Rhabditophora.\[84\] Hence the traditional sub-phylum
"[Turbellaria](../Page/Turbellaria.md "wikilink")" is
[paraphyletic](../Page/paraphyletic.md "wikilink"), since it does not
include the Neodermata although these are descendants of a sub-group of
"turbellarians".\[85\]

## Evolution

An outline of the origins of the parasitic life style has been
proposed.\[86\] Epithelial feeding
[monopisthocotyleans](../Page/monopisthocotylea.md "wikilink") on fish
hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to parasitism
from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary
change from [epithelium](../Page/epithelium.md "wikilink") to
[blood](../Page/blood.md "wikilink"). The last common ancestor of
Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.

The earliest known fossils of tapeworms have been dated to . They were
found in [coprolites](../Page/coprolite.md "wikilink") (fossilised
faeces) from an
[elasmobranch](../Page/elasmobranch.md "wikilink").\[87\]

## Interaction with humans

### Parasitism

[Neurocysticercosis.gif](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Neurocysticercosis.gif "fig:Neurocysticercosis.gif")
demonstrating multiple [cysticerci](../Page/Cestoda.md "wikilink")
within the brain\]\] [Cestodes](../Page/Cestode.md "wikilink")
(tapeworms) and [digeneans](../Page/digenea.md "wikilink") (flukes)
cause important diseases in humans and their
[livestock](../Page/livestock.md "wikilink"), and
[monogeneans](../Page/monogenea.md "wikilink") can cause serious losses
of stocks in [fish farms](../Page/fish_farm.md "wikilink").\[88\]
[Schistosomiasis](../Page/Schistosomiasis.md "wikilink"), also known as
bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic
disease in tropical countries, behind
[malaria](../Page/malaria.md "wikilink"). The [Carter
Center](../Page/Carter_Center.md "wikilink") estimated 200 million
people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the
victims live in Africa. The condition has a low [mortality
rate](../Page/mortality_rate.md "wikilink"), but often is a [chronic
illness](../Page/chronic_illness.md "wikilink") that can damage internal
organs. It can impair the growth and [cognitive
development](../Page/cognitive_development.md "wikilink") of children,
and increase the risk of [bladder
cancer](../Page/bladder_cancer.md "wikilink") in adults. The disease is
caused by several flukes of the genus
*[Schistosoma](../Page/Schistosoma.md "wikilink")*, which can bore
through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected
bodies of water for recreation or
[laundry](../Page/laundry.md "wikilink").\[89\]

In 2000, an estimated 45 million people were infected with the beef
tapeworm *[Taenia saginata](../Page/Taenia_saginata.md "wikilink")* and
3 million with the pork tapeworm *[Taenia
solium](../Page/Taenia_solium.md "wikilink")*.\[90\] Infection of the
digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that are
unpleasant but not disabling or life-threatening.\[91\]\[92\] However,
[neurocysticercosis](../Page/neurocysticercosis.md "wikilink") resulting
from penetration of *T. solium* larvae into the [central nervous
system](../Page/central_nervous_system.md "wikilink") is the major cause
of acquired [epilepsy](../Page/epilepsy.md "wikilink") worldwide.\[93\]
In 2000, about 39 million people were infected with
[trematodes](../Page/trematode.md "wikilink") (flukes) that naturally
parasitize fish and crustaceans, but can pass to humans who eat raw or
lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm
*[Diphyllobothrium latum](../Page/Diphyllobothrium_latum.md "wikilink")*
occasionally causes [vitamin
B<sub>12</sub>](../Page/vitamin_B12.md "wikilink") deficiency and, in
severe cases, [megaloblastic
anemia](../Page/megaloblastic_anemia.md "wikilink").\[94\]

The threat to humans in developed countries is rising as a result of
social trends: the increase in [organic
farming](../Page/organic_farming.md "wikilink"), which uses
[manure](../Page/manure.md "wikilink") and [sewage
sludge](../Page/sewage_sludge.md "wikilink") rather than artificial
[fertilizers](../Page/fertilizer.md "wikilink"), and spreads parasites
both directly and via the droppings of
[seagulls](../Page/seagull.md "wikilink") which feed on manure and
sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods;
imports of meat, [seafood](../Page/seafood.md "wikilink") and
[salad](../Page/salad.md "wikilink") vegetables from high-risk areas;
and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared
with other [public health](../Page/public_health.md "wikilink") issues
such as [pollution](../Page/pollution.md "wikilink"). In less-developed
countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of human
[feces](../Page/feces.md "wikilink") (night soil) as fertilizer and to
enrich fish farm ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, and
poorly designed water-supply and
[irrigation](../Page/irrigation.md "wikilink") projects have provided
additional channels for their spread. People in these countries often
cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough
to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and
livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become
[resistant](../Page/Drug_resistance.md "wikilink") to drugs that used to
be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat.\[95\] While poorer
countries still struggle with unintentional infection, cases have been
reported of intentional infection in the US by dieters desperate for
rapid weight-loss.\[96\]

### Pests

There is concern about the proliferation in northwest Europe, including
the British Isles, of the New Zealand
[planarian](../Page/planarian.md "wikilink") *[Arthurdendyus
triangulatus](../Page/Arthurdendyus_triangulatus.md "wikilink")* and the
Australian flatworm *[Australoplana
sanguinea](../Page/Australoplana_sanguinea.md "wikilink")*, both of
which prey on earthworms.\[97\] *A. triangulatus* is thought to have
reached Europe in containers of plants imported by [botanical
gardens](../Page/botanical_garden.md "wikilink").\[98\]

### Benefits

In Hawaii, the planarian *[Endeavouria
septemlineata](../Page/Endeavouria_septemlineata.md "wikilink")* has
been used to control the imported giant African
[snail](../Page/snail.md "wikilink") *[Achatina
fulica](../Page/Achatina_fulica.md "wikilink")*, which was displacing
native snails, and *[Platydemus
manokwari](../Page/Platydemus_manokwari.md "wikilink")*, another
planarian, has been used for the same purpose in Philippines, Indonesia,
New Guinea and Guam. Although *A. fulica* has declined sharply in
Hawaii, there are doubts about how much *E. septemlineata* contributed
to this. However, *P. manokwari* is given credit for severely reducing,
and in places exterminating, *A. fulica* – achieving much greater
success than most [biological pest
control](../Page/biological_pest_control.md "wikilink") programs, which
generally aim for a low, stable population of the pest species. The
ability of planarians to take different kinds of prey and to resist
starvation may account for their ability to decimate *A. fulica*.
However, these abilities have raised concerns that planarians may
themselves become a serious threat to native snails.\[99\] \[100\]

A study\[101\] in [La Plata](../Page/La_Plata.md "wikilink"), Argentina
shows the potential for planarians such as
*[Girardia](../Page/Girardia.md "wikilink") anceps*, *Mesostoma
ehrenbergii*, and *Bothromesostoma evelinae* to reduce populations of
the mosquito species *[Aedes
aegypti](../Page/Aedes_aegypti.md "wikilink")* and *[Culex
pipiens](../Page/Culex_pipiens.md "wikilink")*. The experiment showed
that *G. anceps* in particular can prey on all
[instars](../Page/instars.md "wikilink") of both mosquito species and
maintain a steady predation rate over time. The ability for these
flatworms to live in artificial containers showed the potential of
placing these species in popular mosquito breeding sites, which would
ideally reduce the amount of [mosquito-borne
diseases](../Page/mosquito-borne_disease.md "wikilink").

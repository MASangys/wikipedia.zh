## History

Lahij has always historically been identified as Aden's base city. Since
Aden was a port city, not may Yemenis lived there, rather it was used by
many foriengers as well for its location. Lahij has always been one of
the very fertile parts of Yemen and was nicknamed "Lahej Al Khathra",
which translates to Lahej the green. This means it stood out from the
rest of South Yemen which was known to be desert. In 1728 Abdulraheem
Al-Sallami (member of the Al-Sallami family who migrated from Sana'a)
established the Sultanate of Lahij and started his own last name after
his own name. Abdulraheem was shorten to Abdali. This was also to make
the distinction between Al-Sallami and Abdali, since not all Al-Sallamis
are Abdalis and therefore not all Al-Sallamis were considered royalty,
although they enjoyed and maintain amongst the highest tribal respect.
The Sultanate of Lahej remained under Al-Sallami/Abdali control until
the Cold War. While the 3rd world was beginning to be recolonized
economically, the Sultanate collapsed in 1967 after the British withdrew
from Aden leaving The Abdalis and Al-Sallamis to fight the
Russian-backed communist movement. From the late 1960s until the
unification of Yemen in 1990 South Yemen was under communist rule,
massive amounts of lands were taken from tribes and redistributed
amongst the entire population. When Ali Abdulla Saleh assumed the
presidency of the new united Yemen in 1990 he returned all the land back
to their rightful owners. [Al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda_in_the_Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink")
captured Lahij in early February 2016, but the government recaptured
later on April.\[1\]

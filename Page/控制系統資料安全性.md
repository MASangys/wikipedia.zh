**控制系統資料安全性**（Control system security）是在[自动化技术](../Page/自动化技术.md "wikilink")及[工業控制系統](../Page/工業控制系統.md "wikilink")中避免因有意或是無意干擾而影響其正常的運作。許多的控制系統會管理電力、石化加工、供水、交通、製造及運輸等基礎服務。其中需要有電腦、網路、作業系統、應用程式及[可编程逻辑控制器](../Page/可编程逻辑控制器.md "wikilink")，其中的任何一項都可能會有[漏洞](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/漏洞 "wikilink")。從2010年發現的[震网](../Page/震网.md "wikilink")蠕蟲就可以看出這些系統在面對網路攻擊時的脆弱\[1\]。因此美國及其他國家通過了要求強化在關鍵基礎建設上控制系統的防護。

控制系統資料安全性也有許多不同的名稱，例如**[SCADA安全性](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA "wikilink")**（SCADA security）、**製程控制網路安全性**（PCN security）、**工業[网络安全](../Page/网络安全.md "wikilink")**（industrial network security）及**控制系統網路安全性**(control system cyber security）。

## 風險

工業自動化及控制系統（IACS）本質上的不安全以及易受破壞，可能會造成重大的影響，例如人員安全性問題、造成人員傷亡、對環境的衝擊、生產力的下降、設備的損壞、資料被竊取，以及公司形象的影響。

目前已有一些可以評估及減輕這些潛在風險的指南，有許多政府標準、行業文件及國際標準已應用這些指南，如下所述。

## 控制系統的脆弱

由於過去10至15年中以下趨勢的出現，工業自動化及控制系統更容易受到安全事件的影響。

  - 大量使用成熟的商業化系統（Commercial Off-the Shelf Technology、COTS）及協定。科技的整合（例如微軟Windows系統、SQL及以太網等技術）表示過程控制系統更容易受到影響IT系統的病毒、蠕蟲和特洛伊木馬的攻擊。

  - 企業網路整合（使用工廠網路、企業網路甚至公開網路）表示舊有的過程控制系統會受到一些之前設計時未考慮到的通訊壓力。

  - 遠端存取的需求：由於工程、運營或是技術支持需要的不間斷存取，也表示對控制系統的連接會更不安全。

  - ：使用非公開可用的技術或是標準會損害系統安全性。

針對自動化系統的網路威脅及攻擊策略正快速的變化。而控制系統安全性的法規很少，因為法規訂定需要一段時間，無法快速更改。例如美國，只有針對[核能及](../Page/美国核能.md "wikilink")[化学工业](../Page/化学工业.md "wikilink")的控制系統安全性有法規要求\[2\]。

## Government efforts

The U.S. Government [计算机应急响应小组](../Page/计算机应急响应小组.md "wikilink") (US-CERT) originally instituted a [control systems security program](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/control_systems_security_program "wikilink") (CSSP) now the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) Industrial Control Systems, which has made available a large set of free National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards documents regarding control system security.\[3\]

## Automation & control system security standards

### ISA/IEC-62443 (Formerly ISA-99)

ISA/IEC-62443 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that define procedures for implementing electronically secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). This guidance applies to end-users (i.e. asset owner), system integrators, security practitioners, and control systems manufacturers responsible for manufacturing, designing, implementing, or managing industrial automation and control systems.

These documents were originally referred to as **ANSI/ISA-99** or **ISA99** standards, as they were created by the  99 committee, accredited by and publicly released as [美國國家標準協會](../Page/美國國家標準協會.md "wikilink") documents. In 2010, they were renumbered to be the **ANSI/ISA-62443** series. This change was intended to align the ISA and ANSI document numbering with the corresponding [国际电工委员会](../Page/国际电工委员会.md "wikilink") standards.

All ISA work products are now numbered using the convention “ISA-62443-x-y” and previous ISA99 nomenclature is maintained for continuity purposes only.

ISA99 remains the name of the Industrial Automation and Control System Security Committee of the ISA. Since 2002, the committee has been developing a multi-part series of standards and technical reports on the subject of IACS security. These work products are then submitted to the ISA approval and then publishing under ANSI. They are also submitted to IEC for consideration as standards and specifications in the IEC 62443 series following the IEC standards development process.

[ISA-62443_Standard_Series_2012.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ISA-62443_Standard_Series_2012.png "fig:ISA-62443_Standard_Series_2012.png") All ISA-62443 standards and technical reports are organized into four general categories called *General*, *Policies and Procedures*, *System* and *Component*.\[4\]

1.  The first (top) category includes common or foundational information such as concepts, models and terminology. Also included are work products that describe security metrics and security life cycles for IACS.
2.  The second category of work products targets the Asset Owner. These address various aspects of creating and maintaining an effective IACS security program.
3.  The third category includes work products that describe system design guidance and requirements for the secure integration of control systems. Core in this is the zone and conduit design model.
4.  The fourth category includes work products that describe the specific product development and technical requirements of control system products. This is primarily intended for control product vendors, but can be used by integrator and asset owners for to assist in the procurement of secure products.

### IEC-62443

The IEC-62443 cybersecurity standards are the result of the IEC standards creation process where ANSI/ISA-62443 proposals are submitted to country committees where review is done and comments regarding changes are submitted. The comments are reviewed by various IEC 62443 committees where comments are discussed and changes are made as agreed upon. Many members of the IEC committees are the same persons from the ISA S99 committees. To date, the fundamental concepts from the original ANSI/ISA 62443 documents have been utilized. \[5\]

These standards are being used by practitioners in several industries to design and evaluate automation systems for cybersecurity resilience. Several of the standards are being used in personnel, engineering process, product, and system cybersecurity certification programs (also called conformity assessment programs).

Certifications are awarded by accredited Certification Bodies (CB) who operate following ISO/IEC 17065 and ISO/IEC 17025. Certification Bodies are accredited to perform the auditing, assessment, and testing work by an Accreditation Body (AB). There is often one national AB in each country. These ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies. ABs are typically members of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs.

## Control system security certification

### The ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI) IEC 62443 Conformity Assessment Program

ISCI created the first conformity assessment scheme (commonly known as a certification scheme) for the ISA S99 IACS cybersecurity standards. This program certifies Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) IACS products and systems, addressing securing the IACS supply chain. exida from the United States was the first organization accredited for the ISCI scheme by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) followed by the Control Systems Security Center – Certification Laboratory (CSSC-CL) accredited by the Japan Accreditation Board (JAB) and TÜV Rheinland accredited by Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle (DAkkS). All of these AB organizations are members of the IAF.

#### ISASecure IEC 62443 Certification Offerings

Two COTS product certifications are available under the ISASecure® brand: ISASecure-CSA (Component Security Assurance) certifying automation products to the 62443-4-1 / 62443-4-2 IACS cybersecurity standards and ISASecure-SSA (System Security Assurance), certifying IACS systems to the IEC 62443-3-3 standard.

A third certification, SDLA (Secure Development Lifecycle Assurance) is available from ISCI which certifies IACS development organizations to the 62443-4-1 cybersecurity standard, providing assurances that a supplier organization has institutionalized cybersecurity into their product development practices.

#### ISO 17065 and Global Accreditation

The ISASecure 62443 conformity assessment scheme is an ISO 17065 program whose labs (certification bodies or CB) are independently accredited by ANSI/ANAB, JAB and other global ISO 17011 accreditation bodies (AB). The certification labs must also meet ISO 17025 lab accreditation requirements to ensure consistent application of certification requirements and recognized tools.

Through Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRA) with IAF, ILAC and others, the accreditation of the ISASecure labs by the ISA 17011 accreditation bodies ensures that certificates issued by any of the ISASecure labs are globally recognized.

#### Test Tool Recognition

The ISASecure scheme includes a process for recognizing test tools to ensure the tools meet functional requirements necessary and sufficient to execute all required product tests and that test results will be consistent among the recognized tools.

#### Traditional Process industries including Chemicals, Oil and Gas

ISCI development processes include maintenance policies to ensure that the ISASecure certifications remain in alignment with the IEC 62443 standards as they evolve. While the IEC 62443 standards are designed to horizontally address technical cybersecurity requirements of a cross-section of industries, the ISASecure scheme’s certification requirements working groups include subject matter experts from the chemical and oil and gas industries and are reflective of their cybersecurity needs.

### Building Management Systems

ISCI published a 2017 study which confirmed applicability of the IEC 62443 standards and ISASecure certification to Building Management Systems. The resulting study, executive summary, and PPT are available for free download from the www.isasecure.org website. ISCI has added leading BMS suppliers to its membership and established a BMS working group to support ongoing expansion of ISASecure certifications for BMS.

### IEC 62443 Certification Programs

IEC 62443 certification schemes have also been established by several global Certification Bodies. Each has defined their own scheme based upon the referenced standards and procedures. Programs are being offered globally by several recognized CBs including exida, TÜV Rheinland, TÜV Sud, TÜV Nord, and SGS-TÜV Saar.

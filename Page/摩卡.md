**摩卡**（），又译**穆哈**，是位于[也门](../Page/也门.md "wikilink")[红海岸边的一个港口城市](../Page/红海.md "wikilink")，現屬[塔伊茲省](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/塔伊茲省 "wikilink")。从十五世纪到十七世纪，这里曾是国际最大的咖啡贸易中心。在15世纪的全盛期，该港垄断了咖啡的出口贸易，对销往阿拉伯半岛区域的咖啡贸易影响特别大。后来新的咖啡种植地区被开发，加之该港泥沙淤积严重，该城咖啡贸易逐步衰落。

摩卡也是一种“巧克力色”的咖啡豆（来自也门的摩卡），这让人产生了在咖啡混入巧克力的联想。

在欧洲，“摩卡咖啡”既可能指这种混合巧克力的咖啡，也可能仅仅指用摩卡咖啡豆泡出来的咖啡。这种混合巧克力的咖啡，与[卡布奇诺](../Page/卡布奇诺.md "wikilink")、[拿铁等](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/拿铁 "wikilink")，成为咖啡饮料的主要品种。

<span id="MochaVariety"></span> Mocha is famous for being the major
marketplace for coffee (*[Coffea
arabica](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica "wikilink")*) from
the 15th century until the early 18th century. Even after other sources
of coffee were found, [*Mocha*
beans](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mocha_coffee_bean "wikilink") (also
called *Sanani* or *Mocha Sanani* beans, meaning *from
[Sana'a](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sana'a "wikilink")*) continued to
be prized for their distinctive flavor—and remain so even today.\[1\]
The coffee itself did not grow in Mocha, but was transported from places
inland to the port in Mocha, where it was shipped abroad.

According to the Portuguese
[Jesuit](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit "wikilink") missionary
[Jerónimo Lobo](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerónimo_Lobo "wikilink"),
who sailed the Red Sea in 1625, Mocha was "formerly of limited
reputation and trade" but since "the Turkish assumption of power
throughout [Arabia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia "wikilink"), it
has become the major city of the territory under Turkish domination,
even though it is not the
[Pasha](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasha "wikilink")'s place of
residence, which is two days' journey inland in the city of
Sana'a."\[2\] Lobo adds that its importance as a port was also due to
the [Ottoman](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "wikilink")
law that required all ships entering the Red Sea to put in at Mocha and
pay duty on their cargoes.

## History

Mocha reached its zenith in the 17th century, owing to its trade in
coffee. The city boasted a stone wall enclosing a citadel, as well as a
labyrinth of thatched huts that surrounded the wall from without. Of
these, some four hundred accommodated Jewish households that engaged in
trade.\[3\] Passing through Mocha in 1752 and 1756, Remedius Prutky
found that it boasted a "lodging-house of the [Prophet
Muhammad](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet_Muhammad "wikilink"),
which was like a huge tenement block laid out in many hundred separate
cells where accommodation was rented to all strangers without
discrimination of
[race](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_\(classification_of_human_beings\) "wikilink")
or [religion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion "wikilink")." He
also found a number of European ships in the harbor: three
[French](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "wikilink"), four
[English](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "wikilink"), two
[Dutch](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "wikilink"), and one
[Portuguese](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "wikilink").\[4\] In
the 18th century, a plague killed half of the city's population, from
which time the city never really recovered.\[5\]

English, Dutch, and French companies maintained factories at Mocha,
which remained a major emporium and coffee exporting port until the
early 19th century. In August 1800
*[Phoenix](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_\(1785\) "wikilink")*
visited. William Moffat, her captain, took the opportunity to prepare a
chart of the mouth of the Red Sea.

Mocha was very dependent on imported coffee beans from present-day
Ethiopia, which was exported by Somali merchants from
[Berbera](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbera "wikilink") across the
Gulf of Aden. The Berbera merchants procured most of the coffee from the
environs of [Harar](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harar "wikilink") and
shipped them off in their own vessels during the Berbera trading
season.\[6\]\[7\]

In December 1820, [HMS
*Topaze*](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_frigate_Étoile_\(1813\) "wikilink")
and ships and troops belonging to the British [East India
Company](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company "wikilink")
attacked the North and South Forts, destroying them. The action was in
pursuit of British demands on the government of the city. A decade and a
half later, [Ibrahim Pasha of
Egypt](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Pasha_of_Egypt "wikilink")
would also attack the city and destroy its fortified wall closest to the
sea, as well as its citadel.\[8\] However, by that time, Mocha's trade
in its country's precious commodity of coffee grains (*[Coffea
arabica](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica "wikilink")*) had
already been supplanted by Ethiopia which was the principal trader of
this commodity to North Africa and which sold for a third of the price
of the same coffee imported from Arabia.\[9\]
[Mocha_Turkish_governor_villa.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mocha_Turkish_governor_villa.jpg "fig:Mocha_Turkish_governor_villa.jpg")

Diplomat [Edmund
Roberts](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Roberts_\(diplomat\) "wikilink")
visited Mocha in the 1830s. He noted that Turkish "rebels" possessed
Mocha. The Turks took it over after they left Egypt while being
disgruntled with the rule of [Muhammad Ali of
Egypt](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt "wikilink").
These "rebels", consisting of confederates throughout
[Arabia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia "wikilink"), had banded
together under one leader named Turkie ben al Mas.\[10\] [Jacob
Saphir](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Saphir "wikilink") who
visited the city in 1859 wrote about seeing many houses that were vacant
of dwellers, although the Turkish governor still dwelt there with a band
of soldiers, collecting taxes from local traders and ships visiting the
harbor.\[11\] When the British took control over Aden, the port in Mocha
fell into disuse, being replaced by Aden. The general destruction of the
city was still prominent as late as 1909, when German explorer and
photographer, [Hermann
Burchardt](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Burchardt "wikilink"),
wrote of the city Mocha as he saw it: “This card will reach you from one
of the most godforsaken little places in Asia. It exceeds all my
expectations, with regard to the destruction. It looks like a city
entirely destroyed by earthquakes, etc.”\[12\]

Mocha was among the population centers in southern Yemen taken over by
the [Houthis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthis "wikilink") during
their [military
offensive](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Yemen_offensive_\(2015\) "wikilink")
in March 2015.\[13\] The city was attacked by pro-Hadi forces in January
2017\[14\]\[15\] and captured by pro-Hadi forces in February
2017.\[16\]\[17\]

At present, Mocha is no longer utilized as a major trade route and the
current local economy is largely based upon fishing and a small number
of tourists. The village of Mocha was officially relocated  west along
the Red Sea shore to accommodate the building and demolition of several
coastal highways.

## Climate

desert](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/hot_desert_climate "wikilink")
(BWh).

**文化权利**运动旨在让人们注意保护人权中关于[文化自由的权利](../Page/文化.md "wikilink")，是[人权运动中关注个体权利的一部分](../Page/人權運動.md "wikilink")。

## 文化保护

文化权利是与艺术和文化相关的权利，在大多数情况下都被允许。
这些权利的目标是保证个体和群体能够拥有文化，能够自主选择自己参与的文化。文化权利旨在确保所有个体在平等的人格尊严和没有歧视的条件下享受文化部分的人权。它们是与[语言等主题相关的权利](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/语言 "wikilink")：文化艺术创作、参与文化生活、文化遗产、知识产权、著作权、少数民族文化保留等。Gregory
Paul
Meyjes提出了可交互的文化交流，而不是将文化保护作为目的的本身，更多地关注文化群体之间“生态”关系的实现，作为公平互动的条件和有机文化变革的能力。

## 群体文化保护

Cultural rights of groups focus on such things as religious and ethnic
minorities and indigenous societies that are in danger of disappearing.
Cultural rights include a group’s ability to preserve its way of life,
such as child rearing, continuation of
[language](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/language "wikilink"), and
security of its economic base in the nation, which it is located. The
related notion of indigenous ***intellectual property rights*** (IPR)
has arisen in attempt to conserve each society’s culture base and
essentially prevent
[ethnocide](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnocide "wikilink").

The cultural rights movement has been popularized because much
traditional cultural knowledge has commercial value, like
ethno-medicine, cosmetics, cultivated plants, foods,
[folklore](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/folklore "wikilink"), arts,
crafts, songs, dances, costumes, and
[rituals](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/rituals "wikilink"). Studying
ancient cultures may reveal evidence about the history of the human race
and shed more light on our origin and successive cultural development.
However, the study, sharing and commercialization of such cultural
aspects can be hard to achieve without infringing upon the cultural
rights of those who are a part of that culture.

Cultural rights should be taken into consideration also by local
policies. In that sense, the [Agenda 21 for
culture](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21_for_culture "wikilink"),
the first document with worldwide mission that advocates establishing
the groundwork of an undertaking by cities and local governments for
cultural development, includes as cultural rights as one of the
principles and states: “*Local governments recognize that cultural
rights are an integral part of human rights, taking as their reference
the [Universal Declaration of Human
Rights](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights "wikilink")
(1948)*”.\[4\]

## 人类文化学

"Cultural rights are vested not in individuals but in groups, such as
religious and ethnic
[minorities](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/minority_group "wikilink")
and
[indigenous](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/indigenous_peoples "wikilink")
societies." All cultures are brought up differently, therefore cultural
rights include a group's ability to preserve its culture, to raise its
children in the ways it forebears, to continue its language, and to not
be deprived of its economic base by the nation in which it is located."
Anthropologists sometimes choose not to study some cultures beliefs and
rights, because they believe that it may cause misbehavior, and they
choose not to turn against different diversities of cultures. Although
anthropologists sometimes do turn away from studying different cultures
they still depend a lot on what they study at different archaeological
sites.

## 殖民時期

1920年[法国殖民时期時建造了一个小型而未铺砌完整的飛行場](../Page/法屬印度支那.md "wikilink")，坐落于新山一以作为民航机场，因此名为新山一机场。在第二次世界大战爆发前，大多数航班都飛行往返法國的航線，也有至东南亚其他地方的航班。第二次世界大战期间，[日本陸軍用新山一机场作为一个运输基地](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/日本帝國陸軍 "wikilink")。1945年8月[日本投降之後](../Page/日本投降.md "wikilink")，[法国空军派遣了一支由](../Page/法国空军.md "wikilink")150人组成的飞行支队接管新山一机场。

第二次世界大战后，新山一机场由国内線班機及進出西貢的国际航班使用。在1952年，法国空军第312特別任務中隊從改駐到新山一，其下的[C-47運輸機和比奇](../Page/C-47運輸機.md "wikilink")18型機（）從新山一出動，執行物資和军事人员運輸任務以支援法軍。

## 越南共和國（南越）空軍使用情形

[Fatherland_-_Space.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fatherland_-_Space.png "fig:Fatherland_-_Space.png")

新山一空軍基地於1953年起開始做為[越南國軍航空隊](../Page/越南國軍.md "wikilink")（）的基地，1955年7月1日後南越成立了新的獨立空軍——[越南共和國空軍](../Page/越南共和國空軍.md "wikilink")。儘管新山一基地在那之前已不時可見法軍和越南軍機，但直到1956年才將空軍指揮部遷入該機場。

1960年代早期，隨著南越空軍規模的擴張，新山一空軍基地派駐的航空器中也有愈來愈多是美軍移交給南越的飛機，例如[T-6教練機](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-6教練機 "wikilink")、[A-1攻擊機](../Page/A-1攻擊機.md "wikilink")、和等。此外基地內的南越空軍單位數量也有顯著的增加，例如1964年1月4日在新山一編成的南越空軍3311聯隊。這樣的趨勢一直發展到1960年代中期，當時新山一據稱已經變成世界上最忙碌擾攘的機場。

### 軍事地位

成為南越空軍大本營的新山一空軍基地，在初期主要僅作為指揮和行政設施使用，大部分的作戰單位都部署在西貢東北方的。南越空軍的人才招募中心也設在新山一。

新山一空軍基地內設有南越空軍在[美國空軍協助下創建的指揮管制系統](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美國空軍 "wikilink")，負責處理軍機從各基地起飛、抵達任務區至返航降落的流程。這套被稱為戰術航空管制系統（）的措施確保了空軍能在各實施戰鬥行動的區域進行正確地管控，一旦缺乏，則可能使南越空軍無法有效地依據需求派遣機隊。的設施緊鄰在南越空軍司令部及美國駐越空軍指揮部旁邊，方便兩者利用。附屬在下的是設於南越各個軍區的（），負責支援各軍區的陸上軍事行動。第1中心（）在、A中心（）在芽莊空軍基地、第2中心（）在、第3中心（）在邊和空軍基地、第4中心（）在[芹苴的](../Page/芹苴市.md "wikilink")[平水空軍基地](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/平水空軍基地 "wikilink")。

在各中心下亦各自設有數個（），由一位以上的南越空軍或美國空軍人員組成，附編在特定的[南越陸軍部隊之內](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/南越陸軍 "wikilink")。戰術空管組－中心－系統構成的三級通信結構使新山一的空軍總部可隨時掌握戰況。除此之外，還設有涵蓋南越及周邊部分地區的[雷達系統](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/雷達 "wikilink")，監控境內的任何攻擊機。

由於新山一空軍基地也是[南越政府軍的參謀總部所在地](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/南越政府軍 "wikilink")，因此在1960年代早期的頻繁政變中數度成為衝突發生的地點。尤其在[1963年倒琰政變中](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963年南越政變 "wikilink")，政變軍在11月1日下午邀請忠於總統[吳廷琰的數位軍官至參謀總部](../Page/吳廷琰.md "wikilink")「參加午餐會」\[2\]，然後以甕中捉鱉之術關住所有人。當中最醒目的人物為支持琰總統的指揮官上校和他的胞弟兼副指揮官——黎光紹少校。之後他們兩人由政變發起者[楊文明將軍的護衛官](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/楊文明 "wikilink")——[阮文戎上尉](../Page/阮文戎.md "wikilink")[射殺](../Page/吴廷琰之死.md "wikilink")，埋入空軍基地旁的洞穴中。

### 1968年春節攻勢

新山一空軍基地在1968年春节攻势中是越南共产党的主要目标. 袭击正在1月30号以比预期更猛烈的程度发生.
袭击发生在南越空军官兵准备回家过新年时.回岗命令立刻被发出，并且90%的南越空军在72小时内重新开始执勤。

第一轮对新山一空军基地袭击发生在一月30日晚约2：00。教堂是空军基地里最早的袭击目标。基地在空军上校法利皮布尔斯指挥下。

如果没有
[美國空軍第377保安憲兵中隊](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美國空軍第377保安憲兵中隊 "wikilink")
和基地中美军四分之三骑兵的帮助,在袭击开始整个空军基地将会处于危险. 4名美軍憲兵在 Bunker 051上丧生;
他们和另外两位战斗保安憲兵因英勇行为获得[银星勋章](../Page/银星勋章.md "wikilink")。保安憲兵尽管寡不敌众,
在 [美国陆军直升机和地面部队帮助下](../Page/美国陆军.md "wikilink"), 击毙近100名敌军.\[3\]
基地被美国和南越海空军戒备直到1968年1月31日中午12：00.

在接下来的3周中,
南越空军出动1300架次袭击，轰炸并扫射越共在南越的据点。从新山一空军基地出发的33D翼运输机在12日内起落15000次,相比平时每月仅10000次.侦察机也从新山一基地起飞约700架次,
并且南越飞行员也驾驶了[O-1 Bird
Dog和](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-1_Bird_Dog "wikilink")[U-17
Skywagons](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_180 "wikilink").

### 戰爭越南化與1972年復活節攻勢

[C-119Gs_413TS_VNAF_TanSonNhut.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:C-119Gs_413TS_VNAF_TanSonNhut.jpg "fig:C-119Gs_413TS_VNAF_TanSonNhut.jpg")
of the VNAF 819th Transport Squadron - Tan Son Nhut Air Base\]\] In
1970, with American units leaving the country, the VNAF transport fleet
was greatly increased at Tan Son Nhut. The VNAF 33d and 53d Tactical
Wings were established flying [Fairchild C-123
Providers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-123_Provider "wikilink"),
C-47s and [De Havilland C-7A
Caribous](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-4_Caribou "wikilink").

By November 1970, the South Vietnamese Air Force took total control of
the [Direct Air Support
Center](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Air_Support_Center "wikilink")
(DASCS) at [Bien Hoa Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_Hoa_Air_Base "wikilink"), [Da
Nang Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang_Air_Base "wikilink") and
[Pleiku Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiku_Air_Base "wikilink").

At the end of 1971, the VNAF were totally in control of command and
control units at eight major air bases, supporting ARVN units for the
expanded air-ground operations system. In September 1971, the USAF
transferred two [Fairchild
C-119](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-119_Flying_Boxcar "wikilink")
squadrons to the VNAF at Tan Son Nhut.

In 1972, the buildup of the VNAF at Tan Son Nhut was expanded when two
[Lockheed C-130
Hercules](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-130_Hercules "wikilink")
squadrons were formed there. In December, the first VNAF C-130 training
facility was established at Tan Son Nhut, enabling the South Vietnamese
to train its own Hercules pilots. As more C-130s were transferred to the
VNAF, older C-123s were returned to the USAF for disposal.

As the buildup of the VNAF continued, the success of the Vietnamization
program was evident during the [1972 Spring
Offensive](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Offensive "wikilink").
Responding to the communist attack, the VNAF flew more than 20,000
strike sorties which helped to stem the communist advance. In the first
month of the offensive, transports from Tan Son Nhut ferried thousands
of troops and delivered nearly 4,000 tons of supplies throughout the
country.

The spring offensive also resulted in additional deliveries of aircraft
to the VNAF under *Project Enhance*. New VNAF units came about with the
introduction of [Fairchild C-119K
gunships](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-119 "wikilink") at Tan Son
Nhut, along with [Boeing
CH-47](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/CH-47_Chinook "wikilink")
helicopters, along with additional C-130 transports and numerous O-1 and
O-2 observation aircraft.

Also, fighter aircraft arrived at Tan Son Nhut for the first time in the
[Northrup F-5A/B Freedom
Fighter](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-5_Freedom_Fighter "wikilink")
and the F-5E Tiger II. The F-5s were subsequently transferred to [Bien
Hoa](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_Hoa_Air_Base "wikilink") and [Da
Nang Air
Bases](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang_Air_Base "wikilink").

### 1973年巴黎和平協約後

[South_Vietnamese_Air_Force_Fairchild_C-123B-15-FA_Provider_55-4565.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:South_Vietnamese_Air_Force_Fairchild_C-123B-15-FA_Provider_55-4565.jpg "fig:South_Vietnamese_Air_Force_Fairchild_C-123B-15-FA_Provider_55-4565.jpg")
[South_Vietnamese_Air_Force_Douglas_C-47A-90-DL_43-15718.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:South_Vietnamese_Air_Force_Douglas_C-47A-90-DL_43-15718.jpg "fig:South_Vietnamese_Air_Force_Douglas_C-47A-90-DL_43-15718.jpg")
The [Paris Peace
Accords](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Accords "wikilink")
of 1973 brought an end to the United States advisory capacity in South
Vietnam. In its place, as part of the agreement, the Americans retained
a Defense Attaché Office (DAO) at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, with small
field offices at other facilities around the country. The technical
assistance provided by the personnel of the DAOs and by civilian
contractors was essential to the VNAF, however, because of the
cease-fire agreement, the South Vietnamese could not be advised in any
way on military operations, tactics or techniques of employment.

It was through the DAO that the American/South Vietnamese relationship
was maintained, and it was primarily from this source that information
from within South Vietnam was obtained. The VNAF provided statistics
with regards to the military capability of their units to the DAO,
however the accuracy of this information was not always reliable.

From the Spring Offensive of 1972, it was clear that without United
States aid, especially air support, the ARVN would not be able to defend
itself against continuing communist attacks. This was demonstrated at
the fighting around
[Pleiku](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiku "wikilink"), [An
Lộc](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Lộc "wikilink") and [Quảng
Trị](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quảng_Trị "wikilink") where the
ARVN would have been defeated without continuous air support, mainly
supplied by the USAF.

The ARVN relied heavily on air support, and with the absence of the
USAF, the full responsibility fell on the VNAF. Although equipped with
large numbers of
[A-37](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_T-37 "wikilink") and
[F-5](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_F-5 "wikilink") attack
aircraft, to conduct effective close air support operations, during the
1972 offensive the USAF relied on the heavier [McDonnell
Douglas](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas "wikilink")
[F-4 Phantom
II](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-4_Phantom_II "wikilink") supporting
ARVN forces dealing with those targets.

Numerous violations of the Paris Peace Accords were committed by
communists beginning almost as soon as the United States withdrew its
last personnel from South Vietnam by the end of March 1973. The North
Vietnamese and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam
continued their attempt to overthrow President [Nguyễn Văn
Thiệu](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguyễn_Văn_Thiệu "wikilink") and
remove the U.S.-supported government. North Vietnamese military forces
broke the treaty, and conquered South Vietnam in their [Ho Chi Minh
Campaign](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_Campaign "wikilink").
The U.S. had promised Thieu that it would use airpower to support his
government. On January 14, 1975 Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger
stated that the U.S. was not living up to its promise that it would
retaliate in the event North Vietnam tried to overwhelm South Vietnam.

When North Vietnam invaded in March 1975, the promised American
intervention never materialized. Congress reflected the popular mood,
halting the bombing in Cambodia effective July 15, 1973, and reducing
aid to South Vietnam. Since Thieu intended to fight the same kind of war
he always had, with lavish use of firepower, the cuts in aid proved
especially damaging.

### 新山一空軍基地失守

carrying about 350 Vietnamese. Returned to USAF service in August 1975,
it was assigned to the 16th Special Operations Squadron (SOS) at [Korat
Royal Thai Air Force
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korat_Royal_Thai_Air_Force_Base "wikilink"),
[Thailand](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "wikilink"), then used
by the United States Air Force [Air National
Guard](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_National_Guard "wikilink") for
many years before being retired in 1989.

Today, this aircraft is part of the [National Air and Space

1975年年初，北越人民軍發起了[1975年春季攻勢](../Page/1975年春季攻勢.md "wikilink")，意在盡快地統一南越。在一系列進攻後，南越總統[阮文紹就宣布放棄了](../Page/阮文紹.md "wikilink")[越南中央高地和北方的兩個省份](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/越南中央高地 "wikilink")。到了30月底時，[峴港](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/峴港 "wikilink")、[歸仁和](../Page/歸仁市.md "wikilink")[芽莊都已經失守了](../Page/芽莊市.md "wikilink")，大規模的逃難潮開始南下，整個共和國陷入紊亂的局面。

As the war in South Vietnam entered its conclusion, the pilots of the
VNAF flew sortie after sortie, supporting the retreating South
Vietnamese Army after it abandoned [Cam Ranh
Bay](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Ranh_Bay "wikilink") on 14 April.
For two days after the ARVN left the area, the Wing Commander at [Phan
Rang Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Rang_Air_Base "wikilink")
fought on with the forces under his command. Airborne troops were sent
in for one last attempt to hold the airfield, but the defenders were
finally overrun on 16 April and Phan Rang Air Base was lost.

The last of the 2d Air Division abandoned the airfield with the
remaining flyable airplanes, leaving four A
[C-119s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_AC-119 "wikilink")
which had flown in from Da Nang and two
[A-37s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_T-37 "wikilink") to the
North Vietnamese.

On 22 April [Xuan
Loc](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuan_Loc "wikilink") fell to the
communists after a two-week battle with South Vietnam's 18th Army
Division which inflicted over 5000 NVA casualties and delayed the *Ho
Chi Minh Campaign* for two weeks. With the fall of Xuan Loc and the
capture of [Bien Hoa Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_Hoa_Air_Base "wikilink") in
late April 1975 it was clear that [South
Vietnam](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam "wikilink") was
about to fall to the North Vietnamese Army.

At dusk on 28 April, three captured A-37s, flown from the former VNAF
[Phan Rang Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Rang_Air_Base "wikilink")
bombed Tan Son Nhut destroying a number of aircraft on the flight line.
There are conflicting stories about who was actually flying these
aircraft. One source insists they were VNAF pilots who were communists,
another says they were VNAF pilots who were forced to fly the mission in
return for the safety of their families, and NVA General Van Tien Dung
claimed the A-37s were flown by North Vietnamese Air Force pilots.

Whatever the case, the A-37s escaped. despite being pursued by several
VNAF F-5s. Although the physical damage to Ton Son Nhut was not
extensive, the threat of further air strikes eliminated Tan Son Nhut AB
for fixed-wing evacuation flights, further lowering what little morale
remained in the capital.

[Saigon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon "wikilink") was now
surrounded by thirteen NVA divisions and most Vietnamese realized it was
only a matter of time until the entire country was in communist hands.
On 29 April President [Gerald
Ford](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford "wikilink") ordered
[Operation Frequent
Wind](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Frequent_Wind "wikilink"),
the helicopter evacuation of Saigon.

Vietnamese pilots now began flying themselves and their families out of
the country in anything that could get off the ground. Some headed for
the American rescue fleet just off the coast, while others flew to
[Thailand](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "wikilink"). On 30
April the last desperate combat sorties flown by the VNAF were carried
out in defense of Tan Son Nhut. An
[AC-119](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_AC-119 "wikilink")
Shadow gunship, which had spent the night defending the base perimeter,
landed for fuel and ammunition. After refueling and rearming, the Shadow
took off again. The gunship orbited the air base firing on advancing NVA
troops and was soon joined by a pair of A-1s. The Skyraiders made
repeated runs over NVA positions until NVA gunners downed one with a
[SA-7](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strela_2 "wikilink"). The second
A-1 pilot continued his attacks until his fuel and ordnance were used
up. All the while, the AC-119 kept its fire directed on advancing enemy
forces.

About 7:00 AM the Shadow was hit by an SA-7 and fell in flames. Three
crewmen managed to bail out, but one chute became entangled in the
debris and the airman killed.

In the final evacuation, over a hundred VNAF aircraft arrived in
Thailand, including twenty-six
[F-5s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_F-5 "wikilink"), eight
[A-37s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_T-37 "wikilink"). eleven
[A-1s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-1_Skyraider "wikilink"), six
[C-130s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-130_Hercules "wikilink").
thirteen
[C-47s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-47_Skytrain "wikilink"), five
[C-7s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_Havilland_Canada_DHC-4_Caribou "wikilink"),
and three
[AC-119s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_AC-119 "wikilink").
Additionally close to 100 VNAF helicopters landed on U.S. ships off the
coast, although at least half were jettisoned. One
[O-1](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_L-19_Bird_Dog "wikilink")
managed to land on the USS Midway CV-41, carrying a South Vietnamese
major, his wife, and five children. On 30 April 1975,
[Saigon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon "wikilink") fell and all
remaining South Vietnamese forces were ordered to surrender.

For the VNAF thirty-five long years of war had come to an end. Following
the war, Tan Son Nhut Air Base was taken over as a base for the [Vietnam
People's Air
Force](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_People's_Air_Force "wikilink").

During the [Vietnam
War](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "wikilink") (or Second
Indochina War), Tan Son Nhut Air Base (then using the alternative
spelling "Tân Sơn Nhứt") was an important facility for both the [US Air
Force](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Air_Force "wikilink") and the
VNAF. Tan Son Nhut Air Base served as the focal point for the initial
United States Air Force deployment and buildup in South Vietnam in the
early 1960s. After 1966, with the establishment of the [7th Air
Force](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Air_Force "wikilink") as the
main USAF Command and Control Headquarters in South Vietnam, Tan Son
Nhut functioned as a Headquarters base, a Tactical Reconnaissance base,
and as a Special Operations base, focusing on areal defoliation
([Operation Ranch
Hand](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ranch_Hand "wikilink")).
With the drawdown of US forces in South Vietnam after 1971, the base
took on a myriad of organizations transferred from deactivated bases in
the country.

Between 1968 and 1974, Tan Son Nhut Airport was one of the busiest
military airbases in the world. During the last days of South Vietnam,
Pan Am schedules from 1973 showed [Boeing

deployed sixty-seven officers and airmen to Tan Son Nhut to install
radars and began monitoring air traffic and training of South Vietnamese
Air Force (VNAF) personnel to operate and service the equipment. This
organization formed the nucleus of what became a tactical air control
system for a vast fleet of South Vietnamese and American aircraft.

During October 1961, four
R[F-101Cs](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-101 "wikilink") and a photo
processing unit from the [15th Tactical Reconnaissance
Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Squadron "wikilink")
of the [67th Tactical Reconnaissance
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/67th_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Wing "wikilink"),
based at [Yokota AB](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokota_AB "wikilink")
Japan, arrived at Tan Son Nhut and joined the combat reporting post,
with the reconnaissance craft flying photographic missions over South
Vietnam and Laos within a few days of their arrival.

The RF-101C was the only Voodoo version to serve in Vietnam. The 67th
TRW was soon followed by detachments of the [15th Tactical
Reconnaissance
Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Squadron "wikilink")
of the [18th Tactical Fighter
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/18th_Tactical_Fighter_Wing "wikilink"),
based at [Kadena
AB](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadena_AB "wikilink"),
[Okinawa](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa "wikilink"), which also
flew RF-101 reconnaissance missions over Laos and South Vietnam, first
from bases in
[Thailand](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "wikilink") and then
from South Vietnam. These reconnaissance missions lasted from November
1961 through the spring of 1964.

RF-101Cs flew pathfinder missions for F-100s in the first USAF strike
against North Vietnam on February 8, 1965. They initially operated out
of South Vietnam, but later flew most of their missions over North
Vietnam out of [Takhli
RTAFB](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takhli_RTAFB "wikilink"), Thailand.
Bombing missions against the North required a large amount of
photographic reconnaissance support, and by the end of 1967, all but one
of the [Tactical Air
Command](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_Air_Command "wikilink")
RF-101C squadrons were deployed to Southeast Asia.

The reconnaissance Voodoos at Ton Son Nuht were incorporated into the
[460th Tactical Reconnaissance
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/460th_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Wing "wikilink")
in February 1966. 33 RF-101Cs were lost in combat in Southeast Asia—24
to [Anti-aircraft
artillery](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_artillery "wikilink")
and small arms fire, 5 to [Surface-to-air
missiles](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile "wikilink"),
one to a [MiG-21](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiG-21 "wikilink"), one
in a sapper attack on its base at Tan Son Nhut AB, and two to unknown
causes. Six were lost in operational (non-combat related) accidents
while serving in Southeast Asia. More than 30 RF-101Cs were lost in
accidents during their early years of service, mainly due to pilot
inexperience.

The last 45th TRS RF-101C left Tan Son Nhut on November 16, 1970,
bringing the era of Voodoo participation in the Southeast Asia War to an
end.

[Mule_Train_Fairchild_C-123B_Provider.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mule_Train_Fairchild_C-123B_Provider.jpg "fig:Mule_Train_Fairchild_C-123B_Provider.jpg")
During January 1962 a detachment of a dozen [Fairchild C-123
Provider](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_C-123_Provider "wikilink")
transports arrived in South Vietnam to provide tactical airlift support
for South Vietnam's hard-pressed ground troops. Called "Mule Train", its
primary purpose was to give the ground forces an assault capability via
airdrop or insertion. Yet the unit also saw a great need for logistic
support entailing daily delivery of supplies to remote sites in Vietnam.

On 13 November 1961, U.S. President [John F.
Kennedy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "wikilink")
approved a recommendation to increase the mobility of South Vietnam's
hard-pressed military. The White House authorized the Air Force to
deploy a squadron of Air Force C-123 Providers and 40 Army [H-21
Shawnee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-21_Shawnee "wikilink")
helicopters to assist South Vietnam's forces. On Dec. 6, the Defense
Department ordered the [346th Troop Carrier
Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/346th_Troop_Carrier_Squadron "wikilink")
(Assault) to the Far East for 120 days TDY "to participate in a
classified training mission" in the official jargon of the day. A second
Mule Train squadron, the [777th Troop Carrier
Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/777th_Expeditionary_Airlift_Squadron "wikilink")
(Assault), arrived in South Vietnam on June 15, 1962. Eventually, both
squadrons were placed under the [315th Air Commando
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/315th_Air_Commando_Wing "wikilink").

Most sources fix Jan. 2, 1962, as the date that the initial group of
aircraft arrived at Tan Son Nhut AB in South Vietnam. All of the initial
Mule Train missions were dedicated to carrying cargo. One-hundred-kilo
sacks of rice were a major item, and at least one pilot over-grossed his
aircraft by figuring them in at 100 pounds. The most typical commodities
were live ducks, chickens, pigs, and cows, packed in locally made pens
of wood and, when necessary, parachuted into the outlying camps. Mule
Train aircraft also transported many Vietnamese natives. On more than
one occasion, a Mule Train crew would smell smoke in the aircraft and
find a traveler cooking food in the aircraft's cargo compartment.

There was no pretense that this was a South Vietnamese cargo operation,
nor was there any training of Vietnamese for the task. Vietnamese were
employed as "kickers" to move the cargo out the rear on re-supply drop.
The C-123 was a relatively simple and rugged aircraft. Its systems could
take the heat and humidity of Vietnam better than more sophisticated
aircraft. Tough landing gear and glider-strong fuselage could take the
rough landings on short airfields, where stopping depended upon a slow
approach, touching down on the edge of the airstrip, then full reverse
and a steady, heavy foot on the anti-skid brakes.

Soon, the Mule Train route structure became linked to the hard-surface
runways at Da Nang, Tan Son Nhut, Nha Trang, Bien Hoa, Pleiku, Ban Me
Thuot, Huế, Da Lat, Sóc Trăng, Qui Nhơn, and Vũng Tàu. Virtually every
Mule Train sortie began or ended at one of these airfields, but
intermediate stops could be anywhere.

[Mule_Train_Fairchild_C-123B-19-FA_Provider_56-4382.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mule_Train_Fairchild_C-123B-19-FA_Provider_56-4382.jpg "fig:Mule_Train_Fairchild_C-123B-19-FA_Provider_56-4382.jpg")
Two C-123 aircraft were maintained at Da Nang to support northern
outposts. The Mule Train crews were experienced in assault work, but
they had to improvise for conditions in Vietnam. It was difficult to
decide exactly where to drop paratroops over the rough terrain, and much
depended upon the map-reading ability of the crew.

The die was cast on June 28, 1962, when 16 C-123s and 12 South
Vietnamese C-47s dropped paratroops under adverse weather conditions
about 35 miles north of Saigon. The operation went off well despite a
500-foot ceiling.

On other occasions, the C-123s would load up troops from the South
Vietnamese airborne brigade in Saigon to fly to the relief of a village
that had come under attack. Over the village, the C-123 pilot would
reduce power, drop flaps, and spiral down to the drop altitude and give
the paratroopers a green light to jump.

At times, C-123 crews were uncomfortable with the assault role. South
Vietnamese Special Forces were sometimes capricious about when and where
they would fight. Straight cargo operations were hazardous enough,
especially during the monsoon season when South Vietnamese troops were
socked in in the mountainous valleys. To execute the mission, the C-123s
would line up in a proper direction, let down in the undercast, and if
they did not break out by a given altitude, would climb back up. There
were usually 800-foot ceilings in the valleys, and most of the time they
broke out.

Mule Train missions during 1962 became extremely diverse, with the
C-123s serving in roles ranging from duck delivery to napalm bombing. In
the latter role, the Provider carried nine wooden pallets, each holding
three 55-gallon drums of napalm mixed with gasoline. With a good kicker,
the load could go out the back ramp in less than five seconds and leave
a pattern of flame 1,200 feet long.

In October 1962, there began what became known as the Southeast Asia
Airlift System. Requirements were forecast out to 25 days, and these
requirements were matched against available resources. The [315th Troop
Carrier
Group](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/315th_Troop_Carrier_Group "wikilink")
and 8th Aerial Port Squadron came into being and set the stage for
tighter control of airlift operations. The era of the Mule Train
operation was over. It left behind a record of success and a collection
of procedures and techniques for cargo work in Southeast Asia.

#### The Dirty Thirty

Additional USAF personnel arrived at Tan Son Nhut in early 1962 after
the VNAF transferred two dozen seasoned pilots from the 1st
Transportation Group at Tan Son Nhut to provide aircrews for the newly
activated [2nd Fighter
Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Fighter_Squadron "wikilink")
then undergoing training at [Bien Hoa Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_Hoa_Air_Base "wikilink"). This
sudden loss of qualified C-47 pilots brought the 1st Transportation
Group's airlift capability dangerously low.

In order to alleviate the problem, [United States Secretary of
Defense](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "wikilink")
[Robert
McNamara](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara "wikilink"), on
the recommendation of the [Military Assistance Advisory
Group](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Assistance_Advisory_Group "wikilink")
(MAAG) Vietnam, ordered thirty USAF pilots temporarily assigned to the
VNAF to serve as C-47 co-pilots. This influx of U.S. personnel quickly
returned the 1st TG to full strength.

The Americans arrived at Tan Son Nhut during March and April 1962 and
immediately began flying with Vietnamese crews. Unfortunately, problems
arose between the Americans and Vietnamese and by August the situation
had so deteriorated that the 1st Transportation Group commander. [Nguyen
Cao Ky](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguyen_Cao_Ky "wikilink") urgently
appealed for closer cooperation and understanding between the two
groups. The situation seemed to gradually improve and although there
were still problems, the two groups developed a closer working
relationship.

Unlike the USAF *[Farm
Gate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Gate "wikilink")* personnel at
[Bien Hoa Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_Hoa_Air_Base "wikilink"), the
C-47 co-pilots actually became part of the VNAF operational structure -
though still under U.S. control. Because of their rather unusual
situation, these pilots soon adopted the very unofficial nickname, *The
Dirty Thirty*.

In a sense they were the first U.S. airmen actually committed to combat
in Vietnam, rather than being assigned as advisors or support personnel.

The original Dirty Thirty pilots eventually rotated home during early
1963 and were replaced by a second contingent of American pilots. This
detachment remained with the VNAF until December 1963 when they were
withdrawn from Vietnam.

### 第509戰鬥攔截中隊

Starting in 1962, the [509th Fighter-Interceptor
Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/509th_Fighter-Interceptor_Squadron "wikilink")
began rotating Convair [F-102A Delta
Dagger](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-102A_Delta_Dagger "wikilink")
interceptors to Tan Son Nhut Air Base on a rotating basis to provide air
defense of the Saigon area in the event of a North Vietnamese air
attack. These rotations from Clark ended in July 1970.

F-102's and TF-102's (two seat trainer version)were deployed to Tan Son
Nhut initially because ground radar sites frequently painted small
aircraft penetrating South Vietnamese airspace from the north. To
determine if the unknown aircraft were infiltrators, drug smugglers or
tourists, the F-102's were put on air defense alert, ready to scramble,
intercept and identify the unknown, light aircraft that were crossing
into South Vietnam.

The F-102, a supersonic, high altitude fighter interceptor designed to
intercept Soviet bombers was given the mission of
intercepting,identifying and, if necessary, destroying small aircraft,
flying from tree top level to 2000 ft at speeds less than the final
approach landing speed of the F-102. The TF-102, employing two pilots
with one acting solely as radar intercept operator, was considered to be
safer and more efficient as a low altitude interceptor.

Before the rotation ended in July 1970, pilots and F-102 aircraft from
other Far East squadrons were used in the deployment. F-102's were also
deployed to DaNang on a temporary basis.

On 8 July 1963 the MAAG units were organized as the [33d Tactical
Group](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/33d_Tactical_Group "wikilink"). The
Group was equipped primarily with cargo aircraft, [C-54
Skymasters](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-54_Skymaster "wikilink"),
[U-3Bs](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_310 "wikilink"),
[VC-47](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-47_Skytrain "wikilink"), and
[VC-123z](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-123_Provider "wikilink").

Its mission was to maintain and operate base support facilities at Tan
Son Nhut, supporting the 2d Air Division and subordinate units by
performing reconnaissance of Vietnam from various detachments flying
[RB-26 Invaders](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-26_Invader "wikilink"),
[RB-57
Canberras](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-57_Canberra "wikilink"), and
[RF-101 Voodoo](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-101 "wikilink")
aircraft.

The early months of 1964 were a time of expansion, training, and
comparative quiet. By midyear, the South Vietnamese Air Force had grown
to thirteen squadrons; four fighter, four observation, three helicopter,
and two C-47 transport. The South Vietnamese followed the practice of
the U.S. Air Force, organizing the squadrons into wings, with one wing
located in each of the four corps tactical zones at [Cần
Thơ](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cần_Thơ "wikilink") Air Base, Tan
Son Nhut Air Base, [Pleiku Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiku_Air_Base "wikilink"), and [Da
Nang Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang_Air_Base "wikilink")

After the [Tonkin Gulf
incident](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonkin_Gulf_incident "wikilink"),
the USAF response was to deploy twelve [F-102 Delta
Dagger](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-102_Delta_Dagger "wikilink") air
defense interceptor aircraft, their number divided between Tan Son Nhut
and at [Da Nang Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang_Air_Base "wikilink"). In
addition, eight [F-100 Super
Sabres](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-100_Super_Sabre "wikilink")
joined the F-102s at Da Nang, and two squadrons of [B-57
Canberra](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-57_Canberra "wikilink") light
bombers landed at Bien Hoa Air Base.

#### Patricia Lynn Project

The need for additional reconnaissance assets, especially those capable
of operating at night, led to a classified strategic reconnaissance
project which began in May 1963. Earlier that year, the Air Force
awarded the General Dynamics company a contract to modify two [B-57E
Canberras](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-57E_Canberra "wikilink")
(55-4243, 55-4245) as all-weather high-altitude strategic reconnaissance
aircraft.

General Dynamics was chosen to make modifications to the B-57E as it had
extensive experience in modifying Canberras with the RB-57D and RB-57F
projects and turning the B-57 into a high-altitude reconnaissance
aircraft equipped with various electronic and imagery equipment. The
forward nose section of the B-57Es were modified to house a KA-1 36-inch
forward oblique camera and a low panoramic KA-56 camera used on the
Lockheed U-2. Mounted inside the specially-configured bomb bay door was
a KA-1 vertical camera, a K-477 split vertical day-night camera, an
infrared scanner, and a KA-1 left oblique camera. The modified aircraft
were redesignated RB-57E.

The [2d Air
Division](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2d_Air_Division "wikilink") was
desperate for tactical intelligence and on arrival the pilots that
ferried in the RB-57Es were immediately assigned to the Division as
combat crews and briefed on missions by Divisional intelligence officers
on the reconnaissance flights they would make.

The first mission was flown on 7 May 1963 by the highly-classified
Patricia Lynn squadron (Detachment 1, [33d Tactical
Group](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/33d_Tactical_Group "wikilink"),
later 6250th Combat Support Group, later [460th Tactical Reconnaissance
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/460th_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Wing "wikilink"))
operating from Tan Son Nhut AB. The Detachment flew nighttime
reconnaissance missions to identify [Viet
Cong](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong "wikilink") base camps,
small arms factories, and storage and training areas. The sorties
yielded results that heretofore only had been wished for.

The nighttime imagery showed Communist training and base camps; small,
hidden factories and storage dumps that [RF-101
Voodoo](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF-101_Voodoo "wikilink") crews
had flown over during the day and had been unable to locate from the
air. The existing RF-101s in 1963 could only photograph a few kilometers
(they had to fly very low) per flight with their cameras. The RB-57Es
could image the whole border with
[Cambodia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia "wikilink") in 2 1/2
flights at 16,000 to 17,000 feet with superior results.

From then on, the Patricia Lynn crews both night and day missions over
South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and areas of North Vietnam until 1971,
being some of the last USAF tactical aircraft to be withdrawn from the
country. The RB-57Es carried the call-sign "Moonglow". Some missions
were flown at low-level over single targets, others consisted of 4-6
specific targets. At night RB-57Es flew the canals and rivers in the
[Mekong Delta](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekong_Delta "wikilink")
and southern part of South Vietnam. The sampans were easy to spot with
the "real time" IR if the crew could keep over the canal which was
difficult in the darkness.

The United States began Operation Steel Tiger over the Laos Panhandle
and the DMZ on April 3, 1965, to locate and destroy enemy forces and
materiel being moved southward at night into South Vietnam, and to fly
bomb damage assessment reconnaissance runs over targets attacked in the
secret war in which the United States was engaged there. These flights
teamed with B-57B bombers operating out of [Bien Hoa
AB](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_Hoa_AB "wikilink") and a [C-130
Hercules](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-130_Hercules "wikilink") flare
ship. Three more aircraft were subsequently modified in 1964/65 bringing
the number of aircraft to five.

Two RB-57Es were lost in combat operations. The first (S/N 55-4243) was
lost as a result of a fuselage fire caused by small arms while on a low
level reconnaissance mission in August 1965. The crew ejected safely
when near Tan Son Nhut Air Base. The second aircraft (S/N 55-4264) was
lost on Oct. 15, 1968, after an engine fire started by ground fire
forced the crew to eject.

A sixth Patricia Lynn aircraft (55-4257) joined the team in 1968, as a
replacement for the combat losses. This aircraft had a Terrain Following
Radar designed to allow the aircraft to fly at a constant altitude,
which would, in theory, produce better reconnaissance photos.
Unfortunately, the aircraft flew so low (500–1000 feet) that the
infrared film was used up before the entire assessment area could be
photographed.

A 1968 update, under the Compass Eagle program, gave the back-seater a
video display to monitor the IR scanner system. This allowed the crew to
call in strikes on targets in real time, instead of having to return to
base to get imagery developed, by which time the enemy would have likely
moved on

There were frequent changes and updating of the equipment, including the
installation of 12-inch focal length KA-82 and 24-inch focal length
KA-83 cameras. The infrared equipment was useful in spotting Viet Cong
river traffic at night along the Mekong Delta southeast of Saigon.

In 1969/70, Patricia Lynn missions were flown into Laos and into
Cambodia including Barrel Roll strikes in 1969. The Patricia Lynn
operation was terminated in mid-1971 with the inactivation of the 460th
TRW and the four surviving aircraft returned to the United States.

[505th Tactical Air Control
Group](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/505th_Tactical_Air_Control_Group "wikilink")
was assigned to Tan Son Nhut on 8 April 1964. The Unit was primarily
responsible for controlling the tactical air resources of the US and its
allies in South Vietnam,
[Thailand](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "wikilink"), and to
some extent
[Cambodia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia "wikilink") and Laos.
Carrying out the mission of providing tactical air support required two
major components, radar installations and forward air controllers
(FACs).

The radar sites provided flight separation for attack and transport
aircraft which took the form of flight following and, in some cases
control by USAF Weapons Directors. Forward Air Controllers had the
critical job of telling tactical fighters where to drop their ordnance.
FAC's were generally attached to either US Army or ARVN (Army of
Vietnam) units and served both on the ground and in the air.

Squadrons of the 505th were located as follows:

  - The 619th Tactical Control Squadron at Tan Son Nhut Air Base.
  - The 620th Tactical Control Squadron with responsibility from Pleiku
    to the DMZ, was located at Son Tra, known as "Monkey Mountain."
  - The 621st Tactical Control Squadron which supported tactical air
    operations in Thailand, located at [Ubon Royal Thai Air Force
    Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubon_Royal_Thai_Air_Force_Base "wikilink"),
    and later at [Udon Royal Thai Air Force
    Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udon_Thani_International_Airport "wikilink").
  - The 19th TASS which operated mainly from the Central Highlands
    south, located at [Bien Hoa Air
    Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_Hoa_Air_Base "wikilink").
  - The 20th TASS based at [Da Nang Air
    Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang_Air_Base "wikilink").
  - The 21st TASS headquartered at [Pleiku Air
    Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiku_Air_Base "wikilink").
  - The 22nd TASS based at [Binh Thuy Air
    Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binh_Thuy_Air_Base "wikilink").
  - The 23rd TASS based at [Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force
    Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhon_Phanom_Royal_Thai_Air_Force_Base "wikilink").

The TASS units flew either the O-1G Birddog, O-2 Skymaster, or OV-10
Bronco.

Maintenance support was provided by the 505th Tactical Control
Maintenance Squadron first based at Tan Son Nhut and later at [Bien Hoa
Air Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_Hoa_Air_Base "wikilink")

#### 第619戰術航空控制中隊

The 619th Tactical Control Squadron was responsible from the [Mekong
Delta](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekong_Delta "wikilink") to Ban Me
Thuot in the Central Highlands from 8 Apr 1964-15 Mar 1973. During this

Attacks against Americans in South Vietnam continued. On Christmas Eve
1964, the bombing of a residence for American officers at Saigon brought
the United States to the brink of bombing [North
Vietnam](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam "wikilink"). The
[Johnson
administration's](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson "wikilink")
reluctance to directly engage North Vietnam ended on 7 February 1965,
when the [Viet Cong](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong "wikilink")
attacked an American detachment near
[Pleiku](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiku "wikilink"), killing eight
and wounding 104 American soldiers.

President Johnson approved [Operation Rolling
Thunder](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Rolling_Thunder "wikilink"),
a limited and carefully paced program of air strikes that more closely
resembled the graduated response to the presence of Soviet missiles in
[Cuba](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba "wikilink") than the
recommendations of the [Joint Chiefs of
Staff](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff "wikilink")
for a vigorous and extensive bombardment. Despite the reliance on
gradual escalation, the Johnson administration struck directly at North
Vietnam in an attempt to save South Vietnam unilaterally, regardless of
the weakness or incompetence of the military government in Saigon,
abandoning a policy of partnership with the South Vietnamese that worked
toward political stability and economic progress as conditions leading
to a military victory in the South.

The [United States Air
Force](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "wikilink")
now had four distinct air wars on the mainland of Southeast Asia, as the
offensive against North Vietnam took its place alongside the attacks in
South Vietnam and in northern and southern Laos. In 1965, United States
Air Force was not fully equipped, suitably trained, nor doctrinally
prepared for the situation in Southeast Asia. The transition from
massive retaliation to flexible response and the shift from nuclear to
conventional weapons remained incomplete.

As part of the Operation Rolling Thunder buildup, several [Tactical Air

Sabre](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-100_Super_Sabre "wikilink")

    29 June 1965-1 January 1966
  - [416th Tactical Fighter
    Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/416th_Tactical_Fighter_Squadron "wikilink"),
    1 November 1965-15 June 1966

The 481st was deployed on temporary duty from the [27th Tactical Fighter
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/27th_Tactical_Fighter_Wing "wikilink"),
[Cannon AFB](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_AFB "wikilink"), New
Mexico. The 416th was a
[PACAF](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACAF "wikilink") [31st Air
Division](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/31st_Air_Division "wikilink")
squadron that was moved to TSN from [Bien Hoa
AB](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_Hoa_AB "wikilink"). The 418at
returned to the United States; the 416th returned to Bien Hoa.

### 第6250戰鬥支援大隊

The first tasks facing the USAF, however, were to set up a workable
organizational structure in the region, improve the area's inadequate
air bases, create an efficient airlift system, and develop equipment and
techniques to support the ground battle.

Starting with the buildup in 1965, the Air Force, while continuing to
conduct the four air wars, adjusted its structure in Southeast Asia to
absorb incoming units. Temporarily deployed squadrons became permanent
in November. A wing structure replaced the groups. On 8 July 1965, the
33d Tactical Group was redesignated the 6250th Combat Support Group.

### 第460戰術偵察聯隊

[460th_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Wing_-_Emblem.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:460th_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Wing_-_Emblem.png "fig:460th_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Wing_-_Emblem.png")
[Tah_Son_Naht_Airbase_Christmas.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tah_Son_Naht_Airbase_Christmas.jpg "fig:Tah_Son_Naht_Airbase_Christmas.jpg")
On 18 February 1966 the [460th Tactical Reconnaissance
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/460th_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Wing "wikilink")
was activated and entered the Vietnam War. Its headquarters shared the
[Seventh Air
Force](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Air_Force "wikilink")
Headquarters and the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV).

When it stood up, the 460th TRW, alone, was responsible for the entire
reconnaissance mission, both visual and electronic reconnaissance,
throughout the Southeast Asia (SEA) area of responsibility. On 18
February 1966 the 460th TRW began with 74 aircraft of various types. By
the end of June 1966, that number climbed to over 200 aircraft. When the
460th TRW stood up, the Wing gained several flying units

  - [16th Tactical Reconnaissance
    Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Squadron "wikilink")
  - [20th Tactical Reconnaissance
    Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Squadron "wikilink")

    Thailand)
  - Detachment 1 of the 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing (see:
    [Patricia Lynn
    Project](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Lynn_Project "wikilink"))

On 15 October 1966, the 460th TRW assumed host wing responsibilities for
Tan Son Nhut Air Base, to include being responsible for all depot-level
aircraft maintenance responsibility for all USAF organizations in South
Vietnam. In addition to the reconnaissance operations, the 460th TFW's
base flight operated in-theater transport service for Seventh Air Force
and other senior commanders throughout South Vietnam. The base flight
operated [T-39A
Saberliners](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-39A_Saberliner "wikilink"),
[VC-123B
Providers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC-123B_Provider "wikilink")
(also known as the "White Whale"), and [Cessna

    The 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing's contingent of RF-4Cs

  - RB-66C Destroyer
    In addition to the visual reconnaissance part of the 460 TRW's
    overall mission, the Wing's mission also included electronic
    warfare. To handle the communications countermeasures mission for
    the 460th TRW, the [41st Tactical Reconnaissance
    Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/41st_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Squadron "wikilink"),
    located at Takhli Royal Thai AFB, Thailand flew the [RB-66C
    Destroyer](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB-66C_Destroyer "wikilink").
    On 8 June 1966, the 460 TRW gained another RB-66 squadron, 6460th
    Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, also stationed at Takhli. While
    the 41st and 6460th TRSs completed other electronic warfare
    missions, the primary role of both squadrons was to find enemy radar
    sites in North Vietnam that controlled anti-aircraft missile and gun
    sites. Being unarmed, the RB-66s could not attack these
    anti-aircraft sites themselves. However, after identifying these
    sites, strike aircraft could either try to avoid them or target
    them.

During the end of 1966, the 460th TRW and its responsibilities changed.
First, on 18 September 1966, the [432d Tactical Reconnaissance
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/432d_Tactical_Reconnaissance_Wing "wikilink")
was activated at [Takhli Royal Thai Air Force
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takhli_Royal_Thai_Air_Force_Base "wikilink"),
Thailand. After the 432d TRW activated it took control of the
reconnaissance squadrons in Thailand. With the activation of the 432d
TRW, the 460th TRW was no longer responsible for all air reconnaissance
missions throughout the SEA area of responsibility. However, the 460th
TRW provided the new 432d TRW with continued support in recovering
RF-101 and RF-4C aircraft returning from high priority, high interest
target missions.

In addition to all of its main missions, the 460 TRW took part in
several additional operations, either directly or through supporting it.
During their time in SEA both the 12th and 16th TRSs supported Operation
"Arc Light" by flying bomb damage assessment missions. Additionally,
these two squadron flew "Operation Search" missions that found some of
the targets for "Arc Light".

To help military leaders at all levels better understand the topography
of sections of the DMZ and Laos, on 20 October 1967, the RF-101Cs of the
45 TRS began flying aerial mapping missions as part of Project "Muscle
Shoals." This program morphed into Project "Igloo White" which also
included ground sensors and B-66 electronic warfare aircraft as well as
the RF-101Cs. Ignoo White continued until the United States withdrawal
from South Vietnam in 1972.

Project Niagara: On the morning of 21 January 1968 regular forces of the
[North Vietnamese
Army](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnamese_Army "wikilink")
and [Viet Cong](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong "wikilink")
forces attacked the [US
Marine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Marine "wikilink") strategic
bases at and around [Khe
Sanh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khe_Sanh "wikilink"). Immediately,
the 460th TRW began Project "Niagara" to locate enemy troops and
equipment surrounding Khe Sanh. The efforts of the 460th TRW directly
contributed to the effectiveness of the most intensive bombing campaign
of the conflict, to include the first use of B-52s as tactical bombers
sometimes dropping their bombs with 100 yards of the base. Khe Sanh held
out because of this intensive bombing and aerial resupply. Relief forces
reached the besieged base during the first week of April. At that time
"Niagara" changed to "Pegasus" and continued for three more weeks as US
forces regained control of the area around Khe Sanh.

Project Grand Canyon: The [A Shau
Valley](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Shau_Valley "wikilink"), is a
22-mile long valley located 6 miles from the Laos border close to the
former De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) which separated North and South Vietnam
between 1954 and 1976. The valley became a [North Vietnamese
Army](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnamese_Army "wikilink")
staging area and was one of the main routes for the [Ho Chi Minh
Trail](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_Trail "wikilink") to
funnel troops and supplies towards
[Huế](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huế "wikilink") and [Da
Nang](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang "wikilink"). Also there were
three abandoned airfields and a deserted South Vietnamese Special Forces
camp in the valley. On 10 April 1968 the [United States
Army](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "wikilink") [1st
Air Cavalry
Division](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Air_Cavalry_Division "wikilink")
began Operation "Delaware." To support this the 460th TRW began Program
"Grand Canyon" to locate enemy positions, particularly the anti-aircraft
batteries making up one of the most complex interlocking defensives in
South Vietnam. The 29 day operation cleared out the 5,000 to 6,000 enemy
forces for a time.

#### 電子偵察

A few months after the 460th TRW's activation, two squadrons activated
on 8 April 1966 to take on projects "Hawkeye," "Phyllis Ann," and
"Drillpress." In April 1969 the 460th TRW stood up an additional
detachment to fly EC-47s. This started out as 460th TRW Det 2, but on 1
June 1969 the unit transferred to become 360th TEWS Det 1.

transmitters. Before this program RDF involved tracking the signals on
the ground. Because this exposed the RDF team to ambushes, both the US
Army and USAF began to look at airborne RDF. After some initial
problems, "Hawkeye" was born. While the US Army used [U-6
Beaver](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-6_Beaver "wikilink") and [U-8
Seminole](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-8_Seminole "wikilink")
aircraft for its own version of the "Hawkeye" platform, the USAF
modified several C-47 Skytrains/Dakota. These were one of the main
workhorse during World War II and the USAF had a great many of them in
its inventory

Project "Phyllis Ann": Also used modified C-47s. However, the C-47s for
this program were highly modified with a great deal of advanced, for its
time, navigational and reconnaissance equipment. In essence the
"Hawkeye" and "Phyllis Ann" missions were the same. The real difference
was that the "Phyllis Ann" aircraft were more sophisticated. On 4 April
1967, project "Phyllis Ann" changed to become "Compass Dart". A year
later, on 1 April 1968, "Compass Dart" became "Combat Cougar". Because
of security concerns the operation's name changed two more times first
to "Combat Cross", and then to "Commando Forge".

"Project "Drillpress": Used modified C-47s, their mission was a little
different. Whereas, "Hawkeye" and "Phyllis Ann" tracked Viet Cong radio
traffic to find the enemy and track their movements, "Drillpress"
listened into that traffic and collected intelligence from it. This data
gave insights into the plans and strategy of both the Viet Cong and the
North Vietnam military. Information from all three projects contributed
in a major way to the intelligence picture of the battlefield in
Vietnam. In fact about 95 percent of the [B-52
Stratofortress](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-52_Stratofortress "wikilink")
[Arc
Light](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Arc_Light "wikilink")
strikes conducted in South Vietnam were based, at least partially, on
the data from these three programs. On 6 October 1967, "Drillpress"
changed to "Sentinel Sara".

Lam Son 719: On 8 February 1971 units from the [Army of the Republic of
South
Vietnam](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Republic_of_South_Vietnam "wikilink")
(ARVN) launched Operation "Lam Son 719" into the southeastern panhandle
of Laos. This operation called for ARVN troops to drive west from Khe
Sanh, cut the [Ho Chi Minh
Trail](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_Trail "wikilink"),
seize [Tchepone](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tchepone "wikilink") in
Laos and, after destroying North Vietnamese Army forces and supplies,
then return to South Vietnam. While ARVN provided and commanded the
ground forces entering Laos, US Army and Air Force units furnished
aviation airlift and supporting firepower. Part of that support came
from 460th TRW units like the 362nd TEWS and its EC-47s, and the 460th
TRW Det 1's "Patricia Lynn" RB-57Es. The ability to track enemy units
electronically and through reconnaissance photos was a major factor in
the operations military success. After heavy losses, the ARVN returned
to South Vietnam on 9 April 1971.

Because these three squadrons flew the modified C-47 Skytrains, and many
of the squadron personnel were World War II veterans, squadron personnel
affably dubbed their squadrons "Antique Airlines." Even though these
aircraft were considered vintage, the equipment inside was not and the
US would go to great lengths to prevent this equipment from falling into
enemy hands, As an example, when one EC-47 from the 362d TEWS crashed on
22 April 1970, members of an explosive ordnance unit policed the area
destroying anything they found and six F-100 tactical air sorties hit
the area to be sure. Detachments of these squadrons operated from
different locations, including bases in Thailand. Each of the main
squadrons and their detachments moved at least once due to operational
and/or security reasons. Personnel operating the RDF and signal
intelligence equipment in the back of the modified EC-47s were part of
the 6994th Security Squadron (SS).

#### 終止

Being one of two reconnaissance wings supporting SEA there were few
military operations that did not involve the 460th TRW. Not only did the
460th TRW provide electronic and photo reconnaissance, the Wing's
electronic capabilities allowed it to provide electronic counter measure
support to B-52s returning from striking targets in North Vietnam. The
Wing even gave support to the Cambodian military against the North
Vietnam and Viet Cong forces, as well as support to US units operating
inside Cambodia.

As the Vietnamization Improvement and Moderization Program began,
Vietnamese crews began flying with EC-47 crews from the 360th TEWS and
6994th SS, on 8 May 1971, to get training on operating the aircraft and
its systems. The wing was inactivated in-place on 31 August 1971.
Decorations awarded to the wing for its [Vietnam

['Ranch_Hand'_run.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:'Ranch_Hand'_run.jpg "fig:'Ranch_Hand'_run.jpg").\]\]
Until the last half of 1966 the tactical airlift organization in Vietnam
remained a temporary structure. The PACAF [315th Air
Division](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/315th_Air_Division "wikilink"),
based at [日本](../Page/日本.md "wikilink"), Japan, exercised command of
airlift resources in South Vietnam through the [315th Air Corrrnando
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/315th_Air_Corrrnando_Wing "wikilink")
at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. However, the Army Military Assistance Conmand
(MACV) controlled airlift through the Air Force component of the MACV
joint staff, the [2d Air
Division](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2d_Air_Division "wikilink").
This dual structure of command and control was complex and cumbersome.

The [315th Air Commando
Group](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/315th_Air_Commando_Group "wikilink"),
(Troop Carrier) was activated at Tan Son Nhut AB on 8 December 1962\[6\]
and became responsible for all in-country airlift in the Republic of
Vietnam, including control over all USAF airlift assets, aerial port
squadrons, an aeromedical evacuation squadron, and a special air
transport flight of the Royal Australian Air Force. It was re-designated
the [315th Air Commando
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/315th_Air_Commando_Wing "wikilink")
on 8 March 1966.

Squadrons of the 315th ACW/TC were:

  - [12th Air Commando
    Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_Air_Commando_Squadron "wikilink")
    (Defoliation), 15 October 1966 - 15 July 1970 (Bien Hoa) (UC-123

  - [Royal Australian Air Force Transport Flight, Vietnam
    (RTFV)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._35_Squadron_RAAF "wikilink")
    8 March - 15 October 1966.

The unit also performed C-123 airlift operations in Vietnam. Operations
included aerial movement of troops and cargo, flare drops, aeromedical
evacuation, and air-drops of critical supplies and paratroops.

#### 牧工行動

The 315th ACG was responsible for [Operation Ranch
Hand](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ranch_Hand "wikilink")
Defoliant operations missions. South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem
requested USAF help to remove enemy cover. The USAF's Special Aerial
Spray Flight was already using C-123s in the U.S. to control mosquitoes.
After some modifications to the aircraft (which included adding armor
for the crew), C-123B Provider aircraft arrived in Southeast Asia in
January 1962 under the code name "Ranch Hand".

Flying specially-equipped
[C-123](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-123 "wikilink") Providers,
members of the squadron flew low and slow to reduce the risks to our
soldiers on the ground and to expose the enemy. Ranch Hand never had
more than five C-123Bs. Sometimes these aircraft had their spray
equipment removed to conduct regular airlift flights, and it appeared
that the defoliation mission might be eliminated altogether. With the
increased U.S. commitment in South Vietnam in 1964 and 1965, however,
requests for defoliation soared.

Ranch Hand grew into an essential part of the war effort, with over six
million acres sprayed in South Vietnam between 1965 and 1969. Beginning
in 1965 with only four aircraft, by the middle of 1969 Ranch Hand had
about 25 UC-123 aircraft available for missions. On 15 October 1966,
Ranch Hand became the mission of the 12th Air Commando Squadron.

In 1965 Ranch Hand began using a very effective defoliant called [Agent
Orange](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange "wikilink"), and the
range of targets grew considerably. The Agent Orange controversy later
became both a political and veterans' issue. Operation Sherwood Forest
sprayed the key Viet Cong-controlled Boi Loi Woods northwest of Saigon,
and Operation Swamp Fox targeted the mangrove forests used by the
communist for shelter in the Mekong Delta. Late in the year, operations
extended into the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos. A flood of defoliation
requests came in, and the small number of crews flew constantly.

The defoliation of vital enemy strongholds, transportation routes, and
crops forced the communists to vigorously defend against the spraying.
Ranch Hand aircraft regularly received damage on missions—considering
their low altitude, low speed and large size, they were easy to hit.
Ranch Hand maintainers worked constantly to repair the damage and get
their UC-123s ready for the next mission. In addition to engines and
flight controls shot out, and several crewmen wounded and killed, Ranch
Hand lost five UC-123s in combat between 1966 and 1968.

In February 1967, Ranch Hand was ordered for the first time to fly
missions over the De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) separating North and South
Vietnam. These missions helped uncover infiltration routes from the
north and expose stockpiles of supplies hidden in the DMZ. By June,
1967, the number of UC-123s had increased to 20.

During the Tet Offensive in early 1968, spraying operations were
temporarily halted in favor of airlift missions. Between Feb. 5 and
March 20, Ranch Hand UC-123s flew 2,866 airlift sorties.

The 315th ACW was transferred to [Phan Rang Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Rang_Air_Base "wikilink") on 14
June 1967. With the Vietnamization drawdown in 1969, Ranch Hand was
reduced from 25 to 13 aircraft. In 1970 Agent Orange was discontinued,
and the existing stocks of Agent White ran out in May 1970. After the
last anti-crop mission in January 1971, anti-mosquito spraying continued
for a short time after, and then Ranch Hand ended.

### 第834航空師

[834ad-emblem.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:834ad-emblem.jpg "fig:834ad-emblem.jpg")
Late in 1966 the division was reassigned without personnel or equipment,
to Tan Son Nhut Air Base, South Vietnam, to join Pacific Air Forces
[Seventh Air
Force](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Air_Force "wikilink"),
providing an intermediate command and control organization and also act
as host unit for the USAF forces at Tan Son Nhut Air Base..

The 834th AD was formed from the [315th Troop Carrier Group (Combat
Cargo)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/315th_Troop_Carrier_Group_\(Combat_Cargo\) "wikilink")
and 8th Aerial Port Squadron of the former C-123 Provider "Mule Train"
units, and the "Dirty Thirty" provisional transport units. Initially the
834th AD had a strength of twenty-seven officers and twenty-one airmen,
all of whom were on permanent assignment to Tan Son Nhut.

The Air Division served as a single manager for all tactical airlift
operations in South Vietnam, using air transport to haul cargo and
troops, which were air-landed or air-dropped, as combat needs dictated
through December 1971. The 834th Air Division became the largest
tactical airlift force in the world. It was capable of performing a
variety of missions. In addition to airlift of cargo and personnel and
VNAF training. its missions and activities included "Ranch Hand"
defoliation and insecticide spraying, psychological leaflet
distribution, helicopter landing zone preparation, airfield survey and
the operation of aerial ports.

Units it directly controlled were:

  - [315th Air Commando (later, 315th Special Operations; 315th Tactical
    Airlift)
    Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/315th_Airlift_Wing "wikilink"):

    Located at: Tan Son Nhut AB; later [Phan Rang
    AB](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Rang_AB "wikilink") (15 June
    1967-1 December 1971) U[C-123
    Provider](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-123_Provider "wikilink").
    Composed of four C-123 squadrons with augmentation by C-130 Hercules
    transports from the [315th Air
    Division](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/315th_Air_Division "wikilink"),
    [Tachikawa

<!-- end list -->

  - 2d Aerial Port Group (Tan Son Nhut)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    8th Aerial Port Squadron, Tan Son Nhut (16 detachments)
    14th Aerial Port Squadron, Cam Ranh AB (13 detachments)
    15th Aerial Port Squadron, Da Nang AB (14 detachments)
      -
        Detachments were located at various points where airlift
        activity warranted continuous but less extensive aerial port
        services. Aerial port personnel loaded, unloaded, and stored
        cargo and processed passengers at each location.

The 834th AD also directed its crews to fly aeromedical evacuations
missions within South Vietnam in support of the 903d Aeromedical
Evacuation Squadron at Phu Cat AB, using C-7 Caribous and [C-118
Liftmasters](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-118_Liftmaster "wikilink")
operating from mobile casualty staging facilities at medical field
stations having operating airfields.

In addition, the 834th supervised transport operations (primarily
C-47's) of the [South Vietnamese Air
Force](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnamese_Air_Force "wikilink")
and six A-4 Wallaby transports operated by the [Royal Australian Air
Force](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force "wikilink")
35 Squadron at [Vũng Tàu Army
Airfield](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vũng_Tàu_Airport "wikilink").
The 834th's flying components also performed defoliation missions,
propaganda leaflet drops, and other special missions.

C-123s from the Divisions's [311th Special Operations
Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/311th_Special_Operations_Squadron "wikilink"),
(315th TAW) flew supplies into the surrounded [Khe Sanh Combat
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khe_Sanh "wikilink"),
Vietnam in 1968 in relief of Marines and Army units there. C-130s and
C-7s also flew highly hazardous missions, dropping cargo on the dirt
airstrip at the outpost. The 834th received the [Presidential Unit
Citation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Unit_Citation_\(United_States\) "wikilink")
recognizing their effort.

The Cambodian campaign was an incursion into Cambodia by United States
and South Vietnamese armed forces in May and June 1970. The objective
was to destroy faci1ities and supplies stored by the North Vietnamese
within Cambodia. which the US had previously regarded as a sanctuary.
The operation was supported heavily by tactical air strike and airlift
forces. All three types of airlift aircraft (C-123, C-130, C-7) were
employed by the 834th AD operating into 24 jungle airfields along the
South Vietnam-Cambodian border, and airlifting more than 52.000 tons of
supplies and equipment and 98,000 troops and passengers.

C-l30s airdropped ammunition and supplies to fire base personnel and
Cambodian troops, and during the last week of June, C-7s and C-123s
evacuated more than 3,000 Cambodian refugees from the Cambodian
airstrips of Bung Lung and Ba Kev

During its last few months, the 834th worked toward passing combat
airlift control to Seventh Air Force. On 1 December 1971 the 834th AD
was inactivated as part of the USAF withdrawal of forces from Vietnam.

### 第377空軍基地聯隊

[377abw.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:377abw.jpg "fig:377abw.jpg")
The [377th Air Base
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/377th_Air_Base_Wing "wikilink") was
responsible for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the USAF
portion of the facility from April 1966 until the last USAF personnel
withdrew from South Vietnam in March 1973. In addition, the 377th ABW
was responsible for housing numerous tenant organizations including
Seventh Air Force, base defense, and liaison with South Vietnamese Air
Force.

Units assigned to the 377 ABW were:

  - [834th Air
    Division](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/834th_Air_Division "wikilink")
    (T-39, C-54, C-47, C-118, C-130)
  - [7th Air
    Force](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Air_Force "wikilink")
    (C-47, C-123 and C-54)

### 廢止

In 1972 deactivating USAF units throughout South Vietnam began to
administratively assign units w/o equipment or personnel to the 377th
ABW:

From [Phan Rang Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Rang_Air_Base "wikilink"):

  - [8th Special Operations
    Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/8th_Special_Operations_Squadron "wikilink")
    15 January - 25 October 1972
  - 9th Special Operations Squadron 21 January - 29 February 1972

From [Cam Ranh Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Ranh_Air_Base "wikilink"):

  - 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron 15 March 1972 - 23 February 1973

From [Phan Rang Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Rang_Air_Base "wikilink")

  - 310th Tactical Airlift Squadron January–June 1972 and March–October
    1972 (C-123, C-7B)
  - [360th Tactical Electronic Warfare
    Squadron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/970th_Airborne_Air_Control_Squadron "wikilink")
    1 February - 24 November 1972

All of these units were administratively inactivated in place at Tan Son
Nhut.

An operating location of the wing headquarters was established at [Bien
Hoa Air
Base](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_Hoa_Air_Base "wikilink") on 14
April 1972 to provide turnaround service for [F-4 Phantom
IIs](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-4_Phantom_II "wikilink") of other
organizations, mostly based in
[Thailand](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "wikilink"). It was
replaced on 20 June 1972 by Detachment l of the 377th Wing headquarters,
which continued the F-4 turnaround service and added [A-7 Corsair
IIs](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-7_Corsair_II "wikilink") for the
deployed [354th Tactical Fighter
Wing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/354th_Tactical_Fighter_Wing "wikilink")
aircraft based at [Korat
RTAFB](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korat_RTAFB "wikilink"), Thailand
on 30 October 1972. The detachment continued operations through 11
February 1973.

The 377th ABW phased down for inactivation during February and March
1973, transferring many assets to the South Vietnamese Air Force. When
deactivated on 28 March 1973, the 377th Air Base Wing was the last USAF
unit in South Vietnam.

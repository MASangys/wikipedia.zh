**東亞飛蝗**（）是[飛蝗](../Page/飛蝗.md "wikilink")的一個[亞種](../Page/亞種.md "wikilink")\[1\]。 由於本物種跟同種的[非州飛蝗在體型及結構上的差別很大](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/非州飛蝗 "wikilink")，所以被認為是另一個亞種\[2\]。本物種發現於中國大陸\[3\]及東南亞，是當地農業的主要害蟲，對當地作為主食的禾本科經濟作物造成巨大損耗\[4\]。 東亞飛蝗基本上是一種[独居性昆虫](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/独居性昆虫 "wikilink")（），但在條件適合時，會進入一種[群居模式](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/群居性昆蟲 "wikilink")。這個時候，幼蟲會組成隊伍，一起移動，而成蟲會結集[群行](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/群行行為 "wikilink")。儘管近年東亞飛蝗的爆發無論在規模和次數都下降了，因為農業生產模式的轉變及更好的偵查蝗蟲出現的方法，東亞飛蝗到現在仍然存在，而且依然是重要的農作物害蟲，未來仍然有爆發的可能。

## 簡述

東亞飛蝗在體型上較非州飛蝗為小。其存在可分為獨居階段及群居階段：獨居蝗蟲的顏色可以是綠色或褐色，但當蟲口數量增加，令生活空間下降，褐色的蝗蟲會變成佔多數。 蝗科的[若蟲](../Page/若蟲.md "wikilink")叫作「蝗蝻」（Nymph）或「跳蝻」（Hopper），因為牠們的翅螃還未成長，無法飛行。這些若蟲在初孵化時是灰棕色，但當成長後，牠們的顏色會變為綠色或棕色；而當環境變得乾燥時，棕色會變更常見。當牠們的密度增加，他們開始形成跳蝻帶，顏色變得更紅，呈橙楬色或紅褐色，有黑色斑紋。\[5\]

## 分佈

東亞飛蝗分佈於[東南亞](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/東南亞 "wikilink")。蝗災曾發生於泰国、馬來西亞、爪哇、苏拉威西岛以及日本南端。\[6\]

## Life cycle

The adult female Oriental migratory locust deposits a number of egg pods in the ground over the course of a few weeks. The sites selected include soft soils such as volcanic ash, alluvial soils and sand. Each pod contains between fifteen and a hundred eggs and most females lay from two to seven pods during the breeding season. The eggs hatch 10 to 24 days later and the nymphs develop through 5 or 6 [instars](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/instar "wikilink"), taking between 26 and 61 days to fully develop.\[7\] Females do not lay eggs when the temperature is below , and above this temperature, development times reduces as the temperature rises until  is reached, after which no further reduction takes place.\[8\]

Locusts change their behaviour and are attracted to each other when there are large numbers in close proximity. This behaviour starts when the nymphs are quite small and form a band that move together as a cohesive unit. The band of hoppers can travel a distance of up to  per day, mostly moving downhill, stopping sporadically to feed and bask in the sun. When the insects are fully developed and have wings, they stay together as a swarm. Solitary adults usually fly by night but gregarious ones fly by day. The new adults mature and become sexually active in three or four weeks. There may be up to five generations per year in the Philippines, but in the cooler parts of China, there may be just one or two.\[9\]

## Outbreaks

Outbreaks tend to originate in two types of habitat; soft flood plains periodically inundated by floodwater and forest clearings. In the latter case, the land is cleared for growing crops but when the soil is exhausted it is abandoned and cultivation moves elsewhere. The grasses and weeds that grow in the clearing provide food for locust nymphs and cultivated areas nearby provide soft soil for mass egg deposition.\[10\]

A serious outbreak of the Oriental migratory locust occurred in Indonesia in 1997-1998. It was first observed in the provinces of [Lampung](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampung "wikilink"), [South Sumatra](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sumatra "wikilink") and [Bengkulu](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengkulu "wikilink") in 1997 and then seemed to disappear. It reappeared early in 1998 and intensified, with nearly 20,000 hectares of [rice](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/rice "wikilink") and 15,000 hectares of [maize](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/maize "wikilink") being affected. It may have been triggered by the drought conditions of 1997.\[11\]

Outbreaks in China historically occurred about every ten years, usually after dry summers were succeeded by warm winters. The swarms were mostly restricted by the surrounding uplands to the river valleys.\[12\] Low-lying land that floods intermittently in the delta areas of the [Yellow River](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River "wikilink") has been identified as outbreak centres. During the period 2002 to 2006, outbreaks of hopper bands in this locality were [biologically controlled](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_pest_control "wikilink") with the fungal pathogen *[Metarhizium acridum](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metarhizium_acridum "wikilink")* by ground and aerial applications, giving a kill rate greater than 90%.\[13\]

In the Philippines, there were four major plagues in the first half of the twentieth century. They seem to have originated in southern [Mindanao](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindanao "wikilink") around [Sarangani Bay](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarangani_Bay "wikilink"). They tended to follow periods of below average rainfall. Since about 1960, the Oriental migratory locust has been less of a problem in the Philippines, probably because cultivation practices have changed and there is less untended grassland where populations can build up undetected.\[14\]

An outbreak in southern Japan was discovered on an uninhabited island in 1986.\[15\] A [wildfire](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wildfire "wikilink") had restricted the area available to the locusts for feeding and later provided ideal conditions for egg deposition. Hopper bands with a density of 1000 insects per square metre roamed around and swarms of adults occurred over the whole island; the outbreak was brought under control later in the year by spraying.\[16\]

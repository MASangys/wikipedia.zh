## 生平

Irwin Edman was born in [New York
City](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "wikilink") to
[Jewish](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish "wikilink") parents. He
grew up in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, adjacent
to Columbia University, with which he was to be affiliated his entire
adult life. Edman spent his high-school years at [Townsend Harris
Hall](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsend_Harris_High_School "wikilink"),
a New York high school for superior pupils. He then attended [Columbia
University](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "wikilink"),
where he graduated [Phi Beta
Kappa](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa "wikilink") and
earned his bachelor's degree in 1917, and his Ph.D. in 1920. During his
student years at Columbia he was a member of the [Boar's Head
Society](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boar's_Head_Society "wikilink").\[1\]
He became a professor of philosophy at Columbia, and during the course
of his career he rose to serve as head of the philosophy department. He
also served as a visiting lecturer at [Oxford
University](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University "wikilink"),
[Amherst
College](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst_College "wikilink"), the

and the Brazilian government sponsored a series of lectures he gave in
[Rio de
Janeiro](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro "wikilink").

Edman was known for the “charm and clarity” of his writing, and for
being an open-minded critic. He was a popular professor and served as a
mentor to undergraduate students, notably Pulitzer Prize-winning author
[Herman Wouk](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Wouk "wikilink")
(Columbia class of 1934), who dedicated his first novel to Edman.

He was the brother-in-law of [Lester
Markel](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Markel "wikilink"), the
longtime Sunday editor of The New York Times.

In addition to writing philosophical works, Irwin Edman was a frequent
contributor to literary magazines such as [The New

Magazine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Magazine "wikilink"),
[Harper's](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper's_Weekly "wikilink"),
[Commentary](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentary_\(magazine\) "wikilink"),
and
[Horizon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_\(magazine\) "wikilink").

In 1953, Professor Edman was elected vice president of the [National
Institute of Arts and
Letters](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Arts_and_Letters "wikilink").

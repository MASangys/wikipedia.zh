**死亡勃起**是人類男性在被[處決](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/處決 "wikilink")（尤其是處以[絞刑](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/絞刑 "wikilink")）後，屍體的[陰莖會出現](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/陰莖 "wikilink")[勃起的現象](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/勃起 "wikilink")。\[1\]\[2\]

其原因主要是絞索對[小腦施壓所致](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/小腦 "wikilink")，\[3\]
已知與脊髓損傷也有關係。\[4\]
死亡勃起發生后，陰莖會排出尿液或前列腺中的液體。此外，槍擊頭部、主動脈損傷及被毒殺者的身上也會出現這種現象，因此檢察屍體有無死亡勃起被法醫學當做一種判斷死者生前是否受虐的方法。\[5\]

1.   "Men subjected to capital punishment by hanging and laboratory
    animals sacrificed with cervical dislocation have terminal
    erections. The implication is that either central inhibition of
    erection is released and erection created or that a sudden massive
    spinal cord stimulus generates an erectile response. There is ample
    experimental and clinical evidence to support the former
    supposition."
2.   "Erection has long been observed to follow injuries to the
    cerebellum and spinal cord. Out of eleven cases of cerebellar
    hemorrhage, erection of the penis was noted six times by Serres.
    Death by hanging is often accompanied by partial erection."
3.   "Priapism is sometimes seen as a curious symptom of lesion of the
    spinal cord. In such cases it is totally unconnected with any
    voluptuous sensation, and is only found accompanied by motor
    paralysis. It may occur spontaneously immediately after accident
    involving the cord, and is then probably due to undue excitement of
    the portion of the cord below the lesion, which is deprived of the
    regulating influence of the brain... Pressure on the cerebellum is
    supposed to account for cases of priapism observed in executions and
    suicides by hanging. There is an instance recorded of an Italian
    *castrata* who said he provoked sexual pleasure by partially hanging
    himself."

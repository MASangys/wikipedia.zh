**泛用无界角色扮演系统**（Generic Universal RolePlaying System），简称为GURPS。它是[史蒂夫·杰克逊发展的](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/史蒂夫·傑克遜_\(美\) "wikilink")[角色扮演游戏](../Page/角色扮演游戏.md "wikilink")。这套系统的特色是可以适用在所有已存在及发展中的所有角色扮演游戏。

玩家通过语言描述自己游戏角色的动作，而动作的成功与否取决于角色的技能，动作的难度，和骰子的点数。角色在游戏中获得积分，这些积分可以用来获取更强大的能力。游戏由剧本推进并由[游戏主持者来主持](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/游戏主持者 "wikilink")（通常简称为“ GM”）。

在GURPS的第三版基本说明书中，对“泛用无界角色扮演系统”逐一解释如下：

  - **泛用**：（台、日：**汎用**）每个人玩游戏的口味不一样；有的人喜欢选择简单明确，玩的速度能够很快的方式。有的人则喜欢事物的叙述详实细腻，最好规则也巨细靡遗，越真实越好。而多数人则是藉于两者之间。GURPS只定义了一套最简单的系统规则，但是它提供了许多种不同的备用规则，并且彼此之间不相冲突，让玩家可依喜好而选用不同的备用规则，甚或全然只用基本规则来玩。这是套适合各种人玩的游戏系统。
  - **无界**：GURPS适用于各种体裁的世界。玩家利用GURPS创造出奇幻、科幻世界，也可以创造电脑[黑客](../Page/黑客.md "wikilink")的、超人英雄的、恐怖之夜的、侦探推理的、[二次大战的甚或时光旅行的故事](../Page/第二次世界大战.md "wikilink")。如果你想让你创造的盟军战将活跃在[文艺复兴](../Page/文艺复兴.md "wikilink")时代，GURPS可以轻易达成你的愿望。
  - **角色扮演**：GURPS和某些只需要会砍杀的角色扮演游戏不同，它可以让玩家去表演一个角色，或者是让一个角色表现出一个玩家的特性来。当然，如果你单纯地砍砍杀杀，GURPS无疑地也可以作到。
  - **系统**：GURPS是一套真正完成的系统。有些号称为系统的游戏，最初是一套基本规则的组合，然后不断地出版更新版、修正版，让玩家根本无所适从。GURPS则是完整地给了玩家所有的规则当工具，玩家利用这些工具，无论想创造出什么世界，都可以不受限地创造出来。

這是個規則書百科全書化的系統，適合喜歡剋一堆硬知識的角色扮演遊戲玩家。

## 历史

### 之前的RPG历史

在GURPS之前，1970年代和1980年代初的[角色扮演游戏](../Page/角色扮演游戏.md "wikilink")（RPG）专门针对某些游戏背景而开发，并且彼此之间基本上不兼容。例如，[TSR专门针对](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSR_\(公司\) "wikilink")[奇幻背景发布了](../Page/奇幻作品.md "wikilink")《[龙与地下城](../Page/龙与地下城.md "wikilink")》游戏。同一家公司的另一款游戏《[Star Frontiers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Frontiers "wikilink")》是为基于[科幻RPG而开发的](../Page/科學幻想.md "wikilink")。TSR也为其他背景制作了游戏，例如《[Gamma World](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_World "wikilink")》（[末日冒险](../Page/末日幻想.md "wikilink")），《[Top Secret](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Secret_\(game\) "wikilink")》（[间谍](../Page/间谍.md "wikilink")和特工），《[Gangbusters](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangbusters_\(role-playing_game\) "wikilink")》（[咆哮的二十年代](../Page/咆哮的二十年代.md "wikilink")冒险）和《[布特山](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/布特山_\(遊戲\) "wikilink")》（[美國舊西部](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美國舊西部 "wikilink")）。这些游戏都有自己的独立[规则系统](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/角色扮演游戏规则系统 "wikilink")，而且每个游戏的规则都大不相同。尝试了《龙与地下城高级版》使用《Gamma World》和《布特山》规则进行跨类型游戏；然而，只能通过转换属性将角色用于其他类型游戏。尽管GURPS先于[基本角色扮演系統](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/基本角色扮演系統 "wikilink")（[混沌元素](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/混沌元素 "wikilink")，1980年）和[Hero System](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_System "wikilink")（[Hero Games](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_Games "wikilink")，该系统从1982年开始扩展多种类型）\[1\]，但GURPS是商业上最成功的[通用角色扮演游戏系统](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/通用角色扮演游戏系统 "wikilink")，允许玩家在自己喜欢的任何环境中进行角色扮演，同时仍使用相同的核心规则集。科技水平的使用极大提高了环境的灵活性，可以将背景设置为从石器时代（TL-0）到数字时代（TL-8）或更远。

### GURPS概念

1970年代和1980年代的角色扮演游戏（例如龙与地下城）通常使用掷骰子生成的随机数来为玩家角色分配数据。1978年，史蒂夫·杰克逊为微型游戏[Melee和](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melee_\(game\) "wikilink")[Wizard设计了一种新的角色生成系统](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard "wikilink")，该系统使用了点数购买系统：为玩家提供了固定数量的点数来购买能力。\[2\]（在两年后发布的[Hero System也使用了点数购买系统](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_System "wikilink")。）\[3\]

GURPS强调其通用性已被证明是一种成功的营销策略，因为许多游戏系列都具有可以改装为多种类型的核心规则。\[4\]它的通用性方法包括在任何可能的地方使用现实世界的测量结果（“真实性检查”是每本GURPS书籍的重要组成部分）。

GURPS还受益于数十本世界设计书或额外的规则书，涵盖了所有类型（包括科幻小说，奇幻小说和历史小说）。许多受欢迎的游戏设计师都以GURPS作家的身份开始了他们的职业生涯，包括[C. J. Carella](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._J._Carella "wikilink")，\[5\] [Robin Laws](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Laws "wikilink")，\[6\] [S. John Ross](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._John_Ross_\(game_designer\) "wikilink")，\[7\]和[Fudge的创作者](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudge_\(role-playing_game_system\) "wikilink")[Steffan O'Sullivan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffan_O'Sullivan "wikilink")。\[8\]

### GURPS历史

[Gurps1.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gurps1.jpg "fig:Gurps1.jpg") GURPS的原型是由[Metagaming Concepts发行的史蒂夫](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming_Concepts "wikilink")·杰克逊的微型游戏《[Melee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melee_\(game\) "wikilink")》和《[Wizard](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_\(board_game\) "wikilink")》，最终将它们与另一部杰克逊的游戏《迷宫》结合在一起，形成了早期的角色扮演游戏《幻想之旅》（简称TFT）。\[9\]GURPS的几个核心概念首先出现在TFT中，将包括“力量”，“敏捷”和“智力”作为每个角色的核心能力得分。

基本GURPS集在1986年和1987年出版，包括两本小册子，一本用于发展角色，一本用于冒险。

1990年，GURPS与[黑客 (计算机安全)亚文化产生交集](../Page/黑客_\(计算机安全\).md "wikilink")，\[10\]当时该公司位于[德克萨斯州](../Page/德克萨斯州.md "wikilink")[奧斯汀](../Page/奧斯汀.md "wikilink")的办公室遭到[美国特勤局](../Page/美国特勤局.md "wikilink")的突袭。目标是[GURPS Cyberpunk的作者](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS_Cyberpunk "wikilink")，他涉及到从[南方貝爾](../Page/南方貝爾.md "wikilink")偷来的[E911应急系统文件](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/E911 "wikilink")。\[11\]该事件是[电子前哨基金会](../Page/电子前哨基金会.md "wikilink")成立的直接原因。有一个普遍的误解认为，这次突击是[联邦调查局](../Page/联邦调查局.md "wikilink")“恶魔行动”的一部分。 Operation: Sundevil was in action at the same time, but it was completely separate.\[12\]

A free [PDF](../Page/可移植文档格式.md "wikilink") version of the *GURPS* rules was released as ***GURPS Lite***. This limited ruleset was also included with various books such as *[GURPS Discworld](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS_Discworld "wikilink")* and *[Transhuman Space](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhuman_Space "wikilink")*.

Steve Jackson Games released *GURPS Fourth Edition* at the first day of [Gen Con](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Con "wikilink") on August 19, 2004. It promised to simplify and streamline most areas of play and character creation. The changes include modification of the attribute point adjustments, an edited and rationalized skill list, clarification of the differences between abilities from experience and from inborn talent, more detailed language rules, and revised technology levels. Designed by [Sean Punch](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Punch "wikilink"), the Fourth Edition is sold as two full-color hardcover books as well as in the PDF format.\[13\]

## 游戏机制

### 角色点数

A character in *GURPS* is built with [character points](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/character_point "wikilink"). For a beginning character in an average power game, the 4th edition suggests 100–150 points to modify attribute stats, select advantages and disadvantages, and purchase levels in skills. Normal [NPCs](../Page/非玩家角色.md "wikilink") are built on 25–50 points. Full-fledged heroes usually have 150–250 points, while superheroes are commonly built with 400–800 points.\[14\] The highest point value recorded for a canon character in a *GURPS* sourcebook is 10,452 for the Harvester (p. 88) in *[GURPS Monsters](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS_Monsters "wikilink")*.\[15\]

In principle, a Game Master can balance the power of foes to the abilities of the player characters by comparing their relative point values.

### 属性

Characters in *GURPS* have four basic [attributes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/attribute_\(role-playing_games\) "wikilink"):

  - **Strength (ST)**: A measure of the character's physical power and bulk, ability to lift, carry, and do damage
  - **Dexterity (DX)**: A measure of the character's physical agility, coordination, and manual dexterity
  - **Intelligence (IQ)**: A measure of the character's mental capacity, acuity and sense of the world
  - **Health (HT)**: A measure of the character's physical stamina, recovery speed, energy and vitality, ability to resist disease

Each attribute has a number rating assigned to it. Normally they begin at 10, representing typical human ability, but can go as low as 1 for nearly useless, to 20 (or higher) for superhuman power. Anything in the 8 to 12 range is considered to be in the *normal* or *average* area for humans. Basic attribute scores of 6 or less are considered *crippling*—they are so far below the human norm that they are only used for severely handicapped characters. Scores of 15 or more are described as *amazing*—they are immediately apparent and draw constant comment.

Players assign these ratings spending [character points](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/character_point "wikilink"). The higher the rating the more points it will cost the player, however, assigning a score below the average 10 gives the player points back to assign elsewhere. Since almost all skills are based on Dexterity or Intelligence, those attributes are twice as expensive (or yield twice the points, if purchased below 10). In earlier editions (pre–4th Edition) all attributes followed the same cost-progression, where higher attributes cost more per increase than attributes close to the average of 10.

Attribute scores also determine several *secondary characteristics*. The four major ones are each directly based on a single attribute:

  - **Hit Points (HP)**: how much damage and injury can be sustained, based on *ST* in 4e. In previous editions it was based on HT.
  - **Will (Will)**: mental focus and strength, withstanding stress, based on *IQ*.
  - **Perception (Per)**: general sensory alertness, based on *IQ*.
  - **Fatigue Points (FP)**: a measure of exertion, tiredness, and hunger, based on *HT* in 4e. In previous editions it was based on ST.

The other secondary characteristics (Damage , Basic Lift , Basic Speed, Dodge, Move ) are calculated from one or more attribute values using individual [tables](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/数学用表 "wikilink") or [formulae](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/数学公式 "wikilink").

### 角色优势和劣势

*GURPS* has a profusion of advantages and disadvantages which enable players or Game Masters to customize their characters. The myriad options available and the rewards the system provides players for carefully creating their characters are attractive to gamers who enjoy a high degree of flexibility in character design.

A player can select numerous Advantages and Disadvantages to differentiate the character; the system supports both mundane traits (such as above-average or below-average Wealth, Status and Reputation) as well as more exotic special abilities and weaknesses. These are categorized as physical, mental or social, and as exotic, supernatural, or mundane. Advantages benefit the character and cost points to purchase. Selecting Disadvantages returns character points and allows players to limit their characters in one way in exchange for being more powerful or gifted in other areas. Disadvantages include such positive attributes as honesty and truthfulness which limit the way a character is played. There are also many Perks and Quirks to choose from which give a character some personality. Perks (minor Advantages) and Quirks (minor Disadvantages) benefit or hinder the character a bit, but they mostly add role-playing flavor.

Enhancements and limitations can tailor an advantage or disadvantage to suit creative players. These modify the effects and point cost of advantages and disadvantages. For example, to create a "dragon's breath" attack, a player would select the Innate Attack ability (the ability that allows a player to perform an attack most humans could not), and select burning attack 4D (normally 20 points). Then, the player would modify it as follows: cone, 5 yards (+100%); limited use, 3/day (-20%); reduced range, x1/5 (-20%). The final percentage modifier would be +60%, making the final cost 32 points. This addition to the system greatly increases its flexibility while decreasing the number of specific advantages and disadvantages that must be listed. Finally, *mitigators* can themselves tailor advantages and disadvantages (see *[GURPS Bio-Tech](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS_Bio-Tech "wikilink")* for such an example).

### 技能

*GURPS* has a wide variety of [skills](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/skill_\(role-playing\) "wikilink") intended to enable it to support any conceivable genre (such as [Acrobatics](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/特技 "wikilink") and Vehicle Piloting). Each skill is tied to at least one attribute, and the characters' abilities in that skill is a function of their base attributes + or - a certain amount.

The availability of skills depends on the particular genre the *GURPS* game is played. For instance, in a generic [medieval](../Page/中世纪.md "wikilink") [fantasy](../Page/奇幻作品.md "wikilink") setting, skills for operating a [computer](../Page/电子计算机.md "wikilink"), or flying a [fighter jet](../Page/战斗机.md "wikilink") would not normally be available. Skills are rated by level, and the more levels purchased with character points, the better the characters are at that particular skill relative to their base attribute.

Skills are categorized by difficulty: Easy, Average, Hard, and Very Hard. Easy skills cost few points to purchase levels in, and the cost per skill level increases with each level of difficulty. Game mechanics allow that eventually it may be less expensive to raise the level of the base attribute the skills depend on as opposed to purchasing higher levels of skills. A player can generally purchase a skill for his character at any level he or she can afford. The lower you choose the fewer points it costs to buy the skill, and the higher you go, the more points it costs. Some skills have default levels, which indicate the level rating a character has when using that skill untrained (i.e. not purchased). For example, a character with a Dexterity of 12, is using the Climbing skill untrained. Climbing has a default of DX-5 or ST-5, which means that using the skill untrained gives him a Climbing skill level of 7 (12-5) if he tied it to the Dexterity stat. If the character had a higher Strength stat, he could have a better chance of success if he tied the Climbing skill there instead.

Some skills also have a Tech Level (TL) rating attached to them, to differentiate between Skills that concern similar concepts, but whose tasks are accomplished in different ways when used with differing levels of technology. This helps during time traveling scenarios, or when characters are forced to deal with particularly outdated or advanced equipment. For instance, a modern boat builder's skills will be of less use if he is stuck on a desert island and forced to work with primitive tools and techniques. Thus, the skills he uses are different when in his shop (Shipbuilding/TL8) and when he is on the island (Shipbuilding/TL0).

### 大成功

*GURPS* uses six-sided [dice](../Page/骰子.md "wikilink") for all game mechanics using [standard dice notation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/dice_notation "wikilink"). An ["average roll"](../Page/中位數.md "wikilink") of three six sided dice generates a total of 10.5; this makes an "average" skill check (a skill of 10, based on an unmodified attribute) equally likely to succeed or fail.

Making statistic and skill checks in *GURPS* is the reverse of the mechanics of most other RPGs, where the higher the total of the die roll, the better. *GURPS* players hope to roll as low as possible under the tested statistic's rating or skill's level. If the roll is less than or equal to that number, the check succeeds. There is no "target number" or "difficulty rating" set by the Game Master, as would be the case in many other RPG systems. Instead the GM will apply various modifiers to add or subtract to the skill level. In this way, positive modifiers increase the chance for success by adding to the stat or skill level you must roll under while negative modifiers deduct from it, making things more difficult.

For example: a player makes a pick pocketing test for her character. The character has a Pickpocket skill with a level of 11. Under normal circumstances - i.e., under an *average stressful situation*, according to the manual - the player must roll an 11 or less for the character to succeed. If the player rolls above 11, then the character has failed the attempt at pick pocketing.

There are some exceptions for very high or low rolls, deemed [criticals](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_hit "wikilink"). No matter the level of the skill, a die roll of 18 is always a *critical failure*, and a roll of 3 or 4 is always a critical success (a roll of 17 is a critical failure as well, unless the character relevant skill level is 16 or more). The Game Master may decide in such cases that, in first case (a roll of 18, or 10+ over the modified skill level), the character has failed miserably and caused something disastrous to happen or, in the other case, that he or she succeeds incredibly well and gains some benefit as a result.

### 战斗

Combat in *GURPS* is organized in personal turns: i.e., every character gets a turn each [second](../Page/秒.md "wikilink"), and during his or her character's turn he or she may take an action, such as attack or move. After all characters have taken their action, one second has elapsed. Free actions are simple actions that can be done at any time. Characters in a party have a set initiative that is entirely based upon their Basic Speed characteristic.\[16\]

There are two kinds of attacks: Melee (possibly with hand-to-hand weapons, or unarmed combat) and Ranged (bows, guns, thrown weapons, some Innate Attacks, etc.). Attacks made by a character are checked against their skill with the particular weapon they carry. For instance, if a character is using a pistol, as with any other skill, it is beneficial to have a high level in the [Guns](../Page/枪械.md "wikilink") skill. Like any other skill check, a player must roll equal to or less than the level of the skill to succeed. Failure means a miss, success scores a hit. Similarly, critical hits mean that the blow might inflict significantly more damage to its target; critical misses may lead to a rather unpleasant and unexpected event (such as dropping the weapon or hitting the wrong target). Attack modifiers are set by the GM when factoring in things like distance, speed and cover that make a successful strike more difficult.

After a successful attack, except in the case of a critical hit, the defender usually gets a chance to avoid the blow. This is called an Active Defense, and takes the form of a Dodge (deliberate movement out of the perceived path of the attack), Parry (attempt to deflect or intercept the attack with a limb or weapon), or Block (effort to interpose a shield or similar object between the attack and the defender's body). Unlike many RPG systems, an Active Defense is an unopposed check, meaning that in most cases, the success of an attack has no effect on the difficulty of the defense. Dodge is based on the Basic Speed characteristic, while Parry and Block are each based on individual combat skills, such as Fencing, Karate, or Staff for Parry, and Shield or Cloak for Block. A common criticism is that characters can achieve a relatively high Active Defense value, drawing out fights considerably. The only mechanic within the system to address this is the Feint action, which if successful will place the adversary in an unfavorable position, reducing their active defense against that character only, on the subsequent turn.

Certain skills, attributes and equipment, when strung together, can be used to great effect. Let us say a gunslinger from the Old West is facing a foe; he can use the Combat Reflexes ability to react before his enemy, the Fast-Draw(Pistol) skill to get his two guns out, the Gunslinger ability to allow him to skip the aiming step, and the Dual-Weapon Attack(Pistol) skill to fire both his guns at once. This would have taken around 6 turns, if he had none of these skills.

### 攻击和防御

Damage from muscle-powered weapons, (clubs, swords, bows, etc.) is calculated based on the character's ST rating. The weaker a character is physically, the less damage he or she is capable of inflicting with such a weapon. Purely mechanical weapons (guns, beam sabers, bombs, etc.) have a set damage value.

When damage is inflicted upon characters, it is deducted from their [Hit Points](../Page/生命值.md "wikilink"), which are calculated with the Strength stat (prior to *GURPS* 4th Edition, Hit Points were derived from the Health stat). Like most other RPGs, a loss of hit points indicates physical harm being inflicted upon a character, which can potentially lead to death. *GURPS* calculates shock penalties when someone is hit, representing the impact it causes and the rush of pain that interferes with concentration. Different weapons can cause different 'types' of damage, ranging from crushing (a club or mace), impaling (a spear or arrow), cutting (most swords and axes), piercing (bullets), and so on.

One peculiarity about loss of Hit Points is that in GURPS, death is not certain. While a very high amount of total HP loss will cause certain death, there are also several points at which a player must successfully roll HT, with different grades of failure indicating character death or a mortal injury.

Depending on the nature of the attack, there will sometimes be additional effects.

### 升级

Character advancement follows the same system as character creation. Characters are awarded character points to improve themselves at regular intervals (usually at the end of a game session or story).

GMs are free to distribute experience as they see fit. This contrasts with some traditional RPGs where players receive a predictable amount of experience for defeating foes. The book recommends providing 1-3 points for completing objectives and 1-3 points for good role-playing per game session.

Advancement can also come through study, work, or other activities, either during game play or between sessions. In general, 200 hours of study equals one character point which can be applied for the area being studied. Self-study and on the job experience take more time per character point while high tech teaching aids can reduce the time required.

Some intensive situations let a character advance quickly, as most waking hours are considered study. For instance, characters travelling through the Amazon may count every waking moment as study of jungle survival, while living in a foreign country could count as eight hours per day of language study or more.

## 授权作品

The computer game publisher [Interplay](../Page/Interplay娱乐.md "wikilink") licensed *GURPS* as the basis for a post–[nuclear war](../Page/核战争.md "wikilink") [role-playing video game](../Page/電子角色扮演遊戲.md "wikilink") (*[Fallout](../Page/辐射_\(游戏\).md "wikilink")*) in 1995. Late in development, Interplay replaced the *GURPS* character-building system with their own [SPECIAL System](../Page/異塵餘生系列.md "wikilink"). According to Steve Jackson, "The statement on the Interplay web site, to the effect that this was a mutual decision of SJ Games and Interplay, is not true.  ... We are not clear what their proposal to finish and release the game without the \[*GURPS*\] license entails, for us or for the game, and have absolutely not agreed to it."\[17\] [Brian Fargo](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fargo "wikilink"), one of the executive producers of *Fallout*, stated during an interview that Interplay dropped out of the licensing deal, following fundamental disagreements on the game's content. "\[[Steve Jackson](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/史蒂夫·傑克遜_\(美國\) "wikilink")\] was offended by the nature of the content and where it was going. ... He saw \[the opening cinematic\], and he just wouldn't approve it."\[18\]

*GURPS [For Dummies](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/...For_Dummies "wikilink")* (), a guidebook by Stuart J. Stuple, Bjoern-Erik Hartsfvang, and Adam Griffith, was published in 2006.

## 评价

*GURPS* was ranked 14th in the 1996 reader poll of *Arcane* magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time. The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: "Based around a points system and six-sided dice, *GURPS* succeeds better than most 'generic' games. The rules are flexible and it's well supported – regardless of what you want to do with it, you'll probably find a supplement with some advice and background. The game suffers from being a little too detailed at times, and can get bogged down in numbers. Still, it's an adaptable system with some superb supplements."\[19\]

## History

Mukalla is situated not far from "Cane" or "Qana'", the ancient
principal Hadrami [trading
post](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/trading_post "wikilink") between
[India](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "wikilink") and Africa, with
[incense](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/incense "wikilink") producing
areas in its
[hinterland](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/hinterland "wikilink").\[1\]

Mukalla was founded in 1035 as a fishing settlement. This area was part
of [Oman](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman "wikilink") until the
middle of the [11th
century](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_century "wikilink"), and
later this area became part of Yemen. After witnessing a struggle for
control by the
[Kathiri](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathiri "wikilink") and
[Qu'aiti](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu'aiti "wikilink") Sultanates
in the [19th](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_century "wikilink") and
[20th](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century "wikilink") centuries,
it became the capital of the Qu'aiti State of
[Hadhramaut](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadhramaut "wikilink"), and
then in 1967, it became a part of [South
Yemen](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen "wikilink"). The
Qu'aiti Sultanate was part of the Eastern Aden Protectorate until that
merger, and a British Resident Advisor was stationed at Mukalla. The
other major cities of the Sultanate were
[Ash-Shihr](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash-Shihr "wikilink") and
[Shibam](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibam "wikilink").\[2\]

Captain Haines, a British officer who surveyed Yemen in the 1830s,
described Mukalla as a town of 4500 inhabitants with a significant trade
in slaves.\[3\] In 1934, British traveler and explorer [Freya
Stark](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freya_Stark "wikilink") began her
journey into the hinterland of the Hadhramaut from Mukalla, and her stay
in that city is recorded in her book, *The Southern Gates of
Arabia*.\[4\]

### Yemeni Civil War

During the [Yemeni Civil
War](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_\(2015–present\) "wikilink"),
on April 2, 2015, [Al-Qaida in the Arabian
Peninsula](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaida_in_the_Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink")
(AQAP) stormed the central prison, freeing hundreds of prisoners
including two senior AQAP commanders. They attacked the central bank and
seized 17 billion Yemeni riyals and 1 million U.S. dollars before taking
control of the presidential palace in the city. It was reported the
[entire city was under their
control](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mukalla_\(2015\) "wikilink")
and they plan to establish an Islamic
[emirate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/emirate "wikilink") in the wider
Hadramaut region.\[5\] Mukalla became AQAP's headquarters, and the
capital of their Emirate in Yemen after their takeover.

In April 2015 [Nasser bin Ali
al-Ansi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasser_bin_Ali_al-Ansi "wikilink")
was killed in a US drone strike in the city, the [SITE Intelligence
Group](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/SITE_Intelligence_Group "wikilink")
said, citing media reports.\[6\]

On 3 November 2015, [Cyclone
Chapala](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Chapala "wikilink")
struck the city and destroyed the city's waterfront.\[7\]

In 23 of March, a US airstrike hit an AQAP training camp, killing at
least 50 people. Some days later, AQAP held a major rally in the city,
against the US and their airstrikes.\[8\] In April 2016, is reported
that AQAP bounds at last 1,000 of its fighters inside the Mukalla only,
with their taxes profit in the city to be from 2, to higher than 5
millions of American dollars per day.\[9\]

In the middle of April 2016, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was
consolidating its control in Mukalla and took over control of Mukalla’s
airport from forces affiliated with the pro-Ansar al Sharia Hadhrami
Domestic Council, while also evacuating and planting explosives around
nearby al Dhaba oil port. AQAP also arrested seven Yemeni fighters from
a camp north of Mukalla in Wadi Hadramawt, where the UAE is reportedly
training forces for operations against AQAP. AQAP is also redistributing
property from northern landowners to local tribal leaders in an effort
to shore up support, according to reports. The UAE, a core member of the
Saudi-led coalition, recently led an operation to
[recapture](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahij_insurgency "wikilink")
AQAP-held al Hawta in Lahij governorate, amid reports the country is
seeking U.S. assistance for an expanded counter-terrorism campaign in
Yemen.\[10\]

#### Recapture from Al Qaeda

Mukalla was
[recaptured](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mukalla_\(2016\) "wikilink")
from Al Qaeda on 25 of April, 2016 after [United Arab Emirates Armed
Forces](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates_Armed_Forces "wikilink")
led an assault with the support of [Southern Transitional
Council](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Transitional_Council "wikilink")
forces and expelled them from the city.\[11\]

The UAE has established a primary base of operations against AQAP in the
liberated city.\[12\] The special operations base has enabled the
[CIA](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA "wikilink") and the [Joint
Special Operations
Command](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Special_Operations_Command "wikilink")
(JSOC) to target AQAP’s strongest cells in Yemen and allowed for an
enhanced UAE-US cooperation against AQAP.\[13\]

On 15 May 2016, a [suicide
attack](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/suicide_attack "wikilink") was
carried out in the city by [Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant "wikilink").\[14\]
The attack targeted a police base, killing at least 25 police recruits
and wounding at least 54 others.\[15\]\[16\]

不同的籃球聯賽對於場上的球衣有不同的規範。在籃球早期發展階段中，球員可以穿著任何類型的運動服。但在20世紀初期，特殊的運動服已經被製造出來並販售給籃球員。球衣的風格、剪裁還有合身程度在後來的幾十年中不斷改進，而改進的方向大抵以當時的流行為主。

## 歷史

### Jerseys and shorts

[Kansas_U_team_1899.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kansas_U_team_1899.jpg "fig:Kansas_U_team_1899.jpg") [Carmelo_Anthony_Nuggets.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carmelo_Anthony_Nuggets.jpg "fig:Carmelo_Anthony_Nuggets.jpg")穿著現代的NBA球衣，還配帶著球隊顏色的頭帶與護腕。\]\] 最早，籃球服裝並沒有被規範，而是有各式各樣的種類，從田徑服到美式足球服都有人穿著。The first official basketball uniforms, as displayed in the [Spalding](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spalding_\(sports_equipment\) "wikilink") catalog of 1901, featured three types of pants: knee-length padded pants, similar to those worn for playing football, as well as shorter pants and knee-length tights. There were two types of suggested jersey, a quarter-length sleeve and a sleeveless version.\[1\]

The long pants later evolved into medium-length shorts in the 1920s, and by the 1930s, the material used for jerseys changed from heavy [wool](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wool "wikilink") to the lighter [polyester](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyester "wikilink") and [nylon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/nylon "wikilink"). In the 1970s and 80s, uniforms became tighter-fitting and shorts were shorter, consistent with the overall fashion trends of these two decades.\[2\] At this time, women's basketball uniforms transitioned from longer-sleeved uniforms to [tank-top](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeveless_shirt "wikilink") style jerseys similar to men's basketball uniforms, which more explicitly showed off players' muscle tone.\[3\]

In 1984, [Michael Jordan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan "wikilink") asked for longer shorts and helped popularize the move away from tight, short shorts toward the longer, baggier shorts worn by basketball players today.\[4\]\[5\] Throughout the 1990s, basketball uniforms fell under the influence of [hip hop](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/hip_hop "wikilink") culture, with shorts becoming longer and looser-fitting, team colors brighter, and designs more flashy and suggestive of rappers' [bling](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/bling "wikilink").\[6\] At the turn of the 21st century, basketball uniforms became even more oversized and loose-fitting; the arm holes in women's basketball jerseys remained smaller than men's, but were wide enough to reveal the players' [sports bras](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/sports_bra "wikilink").\[7\] [John_Wall_(Celtics_at_Wizards_1-24-17).jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Wall_\(Celtics_at_Wizards_1-24-17\).jpg "fig:John_Wall_(Celtics_at_Wizards_1-24-17).jpg") and [John Wall](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wall_\(basketball\) "wikilink") wearing the newly introduced sleeved basketball jerseys\]\]

#### Sleeved jersey

For the Christmas Day games of 2013, the NBA and its apparel partner [Adidas](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas "wikilink") introduced a newly designed sleeved jersey with large team and NBA logos on the front.\[8\] Marketers for the new uniforms realized that fans were unwilling to wear sleeveless jerseys in their day-to-day life and hoped the new sleeved jerseys would be more popular for everyday wear.\[9\] However, it was also a "not-so-well-kept secret that the NBA wanted to implement jersey ads in the years following the introduction of sleeved jerseys" as the "sleeves allow more space for potential partners to add their corporate logos to jerseys" like association football (soccer). After the league deal with Adidas expired and [Nike](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc. "wikilink") signed on as the new apparel partner, the sleeved jersey did not continue.\[10\]

The sleeved jersey was controversial among players. LeBron James famously ripped the sleeves off during a prime time game against the [New York Knicks](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks "wikilink") in 2015, but in the [2016 NBA Finals](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_NBA_Finals "wikilink") James convinced his teammates to wear the sleeved jerseys in Game 5 and again in the title-clinching Game 7.\[11\]\[12\]\[13\]\[14\]\[15\]\[16\]

### Shoes

In 1903, a special basketball shoe with suction cups to prevent slippage was added to the official basketball uniform demonstrated in the Spalding catalog.\[17\] Over the decades, different shoe brands and styles were popular as basketball shoes: [Chuck Taylor All-Stars](../Page/Chuck_Taylor_All-Stars.md "wikilink") and [Keds](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keds "wikilink") in the 1960s and 70s; [Adidas](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas "wikilink") and [Nike](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc. "wikilink") leather [high-tops](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-tops "wikilink") in the late 1970s and 80s; and [Air Jordans](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Jordans "wikilink") in the 1990s.\[18\]

### Accessories

In the 1970s, [Slick Watts](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slick_Watts "wikilink") and [Bill Walton](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walton "wikilink") began to wear headbands, which soon became popular with other players. [Rick Barry](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Barry "wikilink") popularized wrist-bands, and other players soon created variations, such as bands that covered their forearms or biceps. These were used to wipe off sweat, or simply worn as fashion statements.\[19\]

## 現代

### 美國籃球

#### 規定

在職業籃球或正式比賽中，主場隊伍通常會穿著比客場隊伍更淺色的球衣。\[20\]

在[NBA](../Page/NBA.md "wikilink")中，球褲褲緣不能超過膝蓋以上一英呎處，而且球衣底下不能穿著[T-shirts](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirts "wikilink")；而美國[大學籃球的規定就比較寬鬆](../Page/國家大學體育協會.md "wikilink")。許多NBA與[WNBA](../Page/WNBA.md "wikilink")在球衣上有著贊助商的廣告標誌。\[21\]

#### 材質

Uniforms are made of [wicking](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wicking "wikilink") material designed to absorb sweat and ensure that it evaporates faster.\[22\] They are the product of a four-year study researching professional basketball players, who identified the need for fewer seams, lighter weight, and faster drying and cooling in their jerseys.\[23\]

### International basketball leagues

The main difference between U.S. basketball uniforms and those of other countries is the appearance of sponsorship iconography; European basketball uniforms are often covered in the logos of their sponsors (similar to association football), while the U.S. uniforms (like other major pro sports) feature the team wordmark/logo front and center.\[24\]

For the 2017-18 season, some U.S. teams have started putting sponsorship logos on their jerseys on the upper left of the jersey which is a maximum of 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches.\[25\]

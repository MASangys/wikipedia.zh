**緊急停止開關**（kill switch、emergency stop），也稱為e-stop，是在緊急情形，機器用正常情形無法關閉時，關閉機器的[安全](../Page/安全.md "wikilink")機制。緊急停止開關和一般關閉的開關或是正常停機程序不同，正常停機程序會依序關閉設備，以免設備受損，而緊急停止開關的設計目的是以最快的速度停止機器運作（即使造成設備受損也沒有關係），而且緊急停止開關的用法需要簡潔，且可以迅速進行（即使是驚慌的操作人員，或是從旁邊經過，不熟悉設備的人，都可以操作）。緊急停止開關會設計的非常醒目，就算是未經訓練的操作人員，或是旁邊經過的人，都可以操作。

大部份緊急停止開關都有保護蓋，是可以開啟的保護性屏障（例如可以打開的塑膠蓋子，或是在緊急停止開關外面加裝玻璃，需要打破才能緊急停止），目的是避免意外啟動緊急停止開關。若有些機械在正常使用或是可預期的誤操作可能會造成人員傷亡，就會設計緊急停止開關，工業設計者加入緊急停止開關，用機器的快速停止（及可能的設備損壞或是製程中斷）來避免人員在工作場所的傷亡，因為人員安全比機器還重要。

[失能开关](../Page/失能开关.md "wikilink")（dead man's switch）是和緊急停止開關類似的系統，失能开关本身是[失效安全](../Page/失效安全.md "wikilink")中的一部份，在操作人員失能時，關閉設備（或是強制開啟設備）。失能开关常用在工業應用（例如[鐵路機車](../Page/鐵路機車.md "wikilink")、塔式起重机、[升降机](../Page/升降机.md "wikilink")）及消費產品（例如[割草機](../Page/割草機.md "wikilink")、拖拉机、[水上電單車](../Page/水上電單車.md "wikilink")、舷外马达、、[摩托車](../Page/摩托車.md "wikilink")及[雪上摩托車](../Page/雪上摩托車.md "wikilink")）。這類的開關在運作時需要使用者一直按著，機器才能正常動作，若開關沒有按著，就會關閉動力來源。有些乘坐式的割草机會在座位上有緊急停止裝置，若座位上沒有足夠的重量，就會停止機械及割草刀。

## Vehicles

[Emergency_Train_Stop_Button.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Emergency_Train_Stop_Button.jpg "fig:Emergency_Train_Stop_Button.jpg") On [鐵路運輸](../Page/鐵路運輸.md "wikilink"), an emergency stop is a full application of the  in order to bring a train to a stop as quickly as possible. This occurs either by a manual emergency stop activation, such as a button being pushed on the train to start the emergency stop, or on some trains automatically, when the train has  or the driver has failed to respond to warnings to check that he/she is still alert, which is known as a [失能开关](../Page/失能开关.md "wikilink"). A similar mechanism is the [看門狗計時器](../Page/看門狗計時器.md "wikilink").

In large ships, an emergency stop button pulls the countershaft for the fuel pumps to the stop position, cutting off the fuel supply and stopping the engines. With a controllable-pitch propeller, the stop button may declutch the engine from the propeller.

[全國運動汽車競賽協會](../Page/全國運動汽車競賽協會.md "wikilink") requires all their stock cars to be equipped with a [方向盘](../Page/方向盘.md "wikilink")-mounted kill switch, in case the  sticks and the driver needs to shut down the engine.

Kill switches are also used on land vehicles as an  and as an emergency power off. Such devices are often placed in s and configured so that observing police can trigger the switch remotely.

A related concept is the [失能开关](../Page/失能开关.md "wikilink"), where the operator must be holding a button or lever any time the vehicle is operating. A common example of this is the kill switches used by [艇](../Page/艇.md "wikilink")ers and [jetskiers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/jetski "wikilink") wherein a cord connects the kill switch to the operator (usually by the operator's [救生衣](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/救生衣 "wikilink") or clothing), and if the operator is thrown overboard in an accident, the cord will pull the switch and immediately shut down the vessel's engine. This prevents it from becoming a runaway vessel that could impose a danger to other vessels or swimmers at sea, and allows the operator to swim back to the vessel and re-board it without the risk of being injured by the boat's propeller. A similar device is featured on most lawnmowers: a lever on the handle blocks the engine's fuel supply and applies a brake to the blades as long as it is not held down.

Monster Truck Racing Association requires all of their [怪獸卡車](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/怪獸卡車 "wikilink") to be equipped with kill switches (either remote or in cab), in case the monster truck loses control and the driver needs to shut off the engine. Monster trucks' kill switches are tested before races.

### Pioneer-era planes and World War I aircraft

Early aviators using -powered aircraft from  , up through the end of  in 1918 had what could be called a reversed functionality version of the "dead man's switch" for cutting the [火花點火](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/火花點火 "wikilink") voltage to the spark plugs on such a power-plant, to give a degree of in-flight speed control for a rotary engine. This was often called [a "blip switch" or "coupe switch"](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_engine "wikilink") (from the French term *coupez*, or "cut") and when not being pressed, allowed the high voltage from the engine's  to operate the ignition with normal engine operation in flight — pressing the "blip switch" cut the flow of high voltage from the magnetos, stopping the combustion process in the cylinders. When such a "blip switch" was intermittently used on landing approach, this allowed a limited degree of engine speed control, as rotary engines generally did not have a conventional [節流閥](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/節流閥 "wikilink") in their carburettors to regulate engine speed, but only for governing the fuel-air ratio for start-up and full-speed operation.

## Industrial machinery

[Emergency_stop_button.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Emergency_stop_button.jpg "fig:Emergency_stop_button.jpg") On large industrial machines, an emergency stop button is typically located on the panel, and possibly in several other areas of the machine. Often, an emergency stop is made wireless using a remote control. This provides a rapid means to disconnect the energy source of the device to protect workers.\[1\] For fail-safe operation, the emergency stop button is a normally closed switch, which ensures that a broken wire will not prevent it from being activated, but may accidentally activate the emergency stop.

In the [欧洲联盟](../Page/欧洲联盟.md "wikilink"), most types of machinery are required to be equipped with an emergency stop according to the . Exceptions apply for machinery in which an emergency stop would not lessen the risk as well as for portable hand-held/hand-guided machinery.

### Nuclear power plants

A kill switch in a nuclear reactor plant is called SCRAM. It is usually characterized as an acronym for "safety control rod axe man".

## Machine tools

The kill switch is also used on such things as band saws and static belt sanders, pillar drills and lathes.

## Fuel stations and road vehicles

A kill switch is also used for [加油機](../Page/加油機.md "wikilink") or any other device that pumps large amounts of [爆炸物](../Page/爆炸物.md "wikilink") or [可燃性](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/可燃性 "wikilink") [化学物质](../Page/化学物质.md "wikilink"). There is commonly a single kill switch for all pumps at a [泵站](../Page/泵站.md "wikilink").

## Elevators and escalators

[Elevators](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator "wikilink") often have a red two-way button on the control panel which is either marked "Emergency Stop" or "Run/Stop". Normally, the button is in the "up" or unpushed position, allowing the elevator to "run" in normal service. When the button is pushed, the elevator comes to an immediate stop. When the button is pulled back out, it resumes normal service, thus the reason for the use of the phrase "Run/Stop". [電動扶梯](../Page/電動扶梯.md "wikilink")s will typically have a key-operated control that will turn the escalator off, or change its direction to up or down. Next to the key switch will be a red "Emergency Stop" button, which is used in the event of equipment failure, or where there is a potential for injury, such as when someone's shoe gets stuck in the "comb" at the top or bottom of the escalator and there is a risk of serious injury. The key switch is used to return the escalator to service after it has been stopped.

## Gym

[跑步機](../Page/跑步機.md "wikilink")s often use a safety key with one end magnetically attached to the machine and the other end clipped to the user's waist. If the safety key is pulled out, such as in the event of a fall, the treadmill stops immediately. In other cases, some other treadmills have a more traditional kill switch, often mounted towards the rear of one of the hand railings.

## Amusement rides

The emergency stop on an  is similar to that on industrial equipment. Typically brakes on a ride are designed to be disengaged when power is applied; disconnecting power will cause all brakes to engage. Most amusement rides have a computer that can, similar to the rail example provided above, engage the emergency stop when such a ride is determined to be out of operating specification.

## Software

By analogy to physical kill switches, "kill switch" can be used to refer to a mechanism incorporated in software. By such its manufacturer or licensor may be able to disable it, for example if the product is withdrawn, or a maintenance fee has not been paid, or a device has been lost or stolen.\[2\]\[3\] It can also refer to kill switches for the stopping of [恶意软件](../Page/恶意软件.md "wikilink") such as in the [WannaCry](../Page/WannaCry.md "wikilink").\[4\]\[5\]

There also is a debate about implementing kill switches in [机器人](../Page/机器人.md "wikilink")s\[6\] and advanced [人工智能](../Page/人工智能.md "wikilink") systems.\[7\]

## Smartphones

In [智能手机](../Page/智能手机.md "wikilink"), a kill switch is a security feature that allows the phone's owner to remotely render the smartphone inoperable if it is lost or stolen. From 2015 this feature is legally required in [加利福尼亚州](../Page/加利福尼亚州.md "wikilink") for smartphones.

## Military

French and Israeli [電子作戰](../Page/電子作戰.md "wikilink") units use kill switches to disable opponents' military systems.\[8\]\[9\]

A **statistician** is a person who works with theoretical or applied [statistics](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/statistics "wikilink"). The profession exists in both the [private](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/private_sector "wikilink") and [public sectors](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_sector "wikilink"). It is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects, and statisticians may work as employees or as [statistical consultants](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/statistical_consultant "wikilink").\[1\]\[2\]

## Nature of the work

According to the United States [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics "wikilink"), as of 2014, 26,970 jobs were classified as *statistician* in the United States. Of these people, approximately 30 percent worked for governments (federal, state, or local).\[3\] As of May 2016, the median pay for statisticians in the United States was $80,500.\[4\] Additionally, there is a substantial number of people who use statistics and data analysis in their work but have job titles other than *statistician*,\[5\] such as [actuaries](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuary "wikilink"), [applied mathematicians](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics "wikilink"), [economists](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/economist "wikilink"), data scientists, data analysts (predictive analytics) [financial analysts](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_analyst "wikilink"), [psychometricians](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychometrician "wikilink"), [sociologists](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/sociologist "wikilink"), [epidemiologists](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/epidemiologist "wikilink"), and [quantitative psychologists](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_psychology "wikilink").\[6\] Statisticians are included with the [professions](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/profession "wikilink") in various national and international occupational classifications.\[7\]\[8\] According to the BLS, "Overall employment is projected to grow 33% from 2016 to 2026, much faster than average for all occupations. Businesses will need these workers to analyze the increasing volume of digital and electronic data."\[9\]

In the United States most employment in the field requires either a [masters degree](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/masters_degree "wikilink") in statistics or a related field or a [PhD](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhD "wikilink").\[10\] "Typical work includes collaborating with scientists, providing mathematical modeling, simulations, designing randomized experiments and randomized sampling plans, analyzing experimental or survey results, and forecasting future events (such as sales of a product)."\[11\]

### 歌詞原文

**第一部份**

  -
    *We are a band of brothers and native to the soil*
    *Fighting for our Liberty, With treasure, blood and toil*
    *And when our rights were threatened, the cry rose near and far*
    *Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star\!*
    *Hurrah\! Hurrah\!*
    *For Southern rights, hurrah\!*
    *Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.*

**第二部份**

  -
    *As long as the Union was faithful to her trust*
    *Like friends and like brethren, kind were we, and just*
    *But now, when Northern treachery attempts our rights to mar*
    *We hoist on high the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.*
    *Hurrah\! Hurrah\!*
    *For Southern rights, hurrah\!*
    *Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.*

**第三部份**

  -
    *First gallant South Carolina nobly made the stand*
    *Then came Alabama and took her by the hand*
    *Next, quickly Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida*
    *All raised on high the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.*
    *Hurrah\! Hurrah\!*
    *For Southern rights, hurrah\!*
    *Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.*

**第四部份**

  -
    *Ye men of valor gather round the banner of the right*
    *Texas and fair Louisiana join us in the fight*
    *Davis, our loved President, and Stephens statesmen rare*
    *Now rally round the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.*
    *Hurrah\! Hurrah\!*
    *For Southern rights, hurrah\!*
    *Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.*

**第五部份**

  -
    *Now here's to brave Virginia, the old Dominion State,*
    *With the young Confederacy at last has sealed her fate,*
    *And spurred by her example, now other states prepare*
    *To hoist high the bonnie blue flag that bears a single star.*
    *Hurrah\! Hurrah\!*
    *For Southern rights, hurrah\!*
    *Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.*

**第六部份**

  -
    *Then cheer, boys, cheer, raise a joyous shout*
    *For Arkansas and North Carolina now have both gone out,*
    *And let another rousing cheer for Tennessee be given,*
    *The single star of the Bonnie Blue Flag has grown to be eleven.*
    *Hurrah\! Hurrah\!*
    *For Southern rights, hurrah\!*
    *Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.*

**第七部分**

  -
    ''Then here's to our Confederacy, strong we are and brave,
    ''Like patriots of old we'll fight, our heritage to save;
    ''And rather than submit to shame, to die we would prefer,
    ''So cheer for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.
    *Hurrah\! Hurrah\!*
    *For Southern rights, hurrah\!*
    *Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.*\[1\]

[Shuttlecocks_Yonex_Aerosensa_20.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shuttlecocks_Yonex_Aerosensa_20.jpg "fig:Shuttlecocks_Yonex_Aerosensa_20.jpg") [ShuttlecockPhoto.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ShuttlecockPhoto.jpg "fig:ShuttlecockPhoto.jpg") **羽球**（或稱）是[羽毛球](../Page/羽毛球.md "wikilink")運動中的器材。每顆羽球皆有一個軟木或橡膠製的球頭，紮有一圈向外展開的羽毛或其他合成材料所構成的裙狀結構，形似底部開放的圓錐體。羽球的形狀讓它受[空氣動力學影響而能穩定飛行](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/空氣動力學 "wikilink")，且無論羽球最初是如何起飛，它最後一定會轉由球頭朝著前進方向，並一直保持此一狀態飛行。

## 名稱由來

羽球的英文「」源自1570年代羽球逐漸興起的[英格蘭](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英格蘭 "wikilink")，在英文中常會簡稱為「」。這個單字由「shuttle」和「cock」組成\[1\]，shuttle之意取自羽球在比賽時前後來回移動，類似[織布機使用的](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/織布機 "wikilink")；cock則是形容球的羽毛像是公雞身上的羽毛。

## 規格

根據[世界羽聯公布的](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/世界羽聯 "wikilink")《羽球規則》，每顆羽球的重量介於之間，需要由一個軟木製球頭及16片、每片長約的羽毛構成；球頭直徑介於，而球頭另一端由16片羽毛圍繞而成的開口直徑為。最後要以線或其他適合的材料捆紮固定\[2\]\[3\]。

非羽毛所製成的羽球，可用類似羽毛之合成材料替代天然羽毛來製作裙身，其基座仍須使用與上述規格相同的軟木製球頭，而羽毛長度與整體重量受合成材料的比重和其他特性影響，可以有百分之十以內的誤差\[4\]\[5\]。

## 構造與材料

A shuttlecock is formed from 16 or so overlapping feathers, usually goose or duck, embedded into a rounded cork base. The cork is covered with thin leather.\[6\] To ensure satisfactory flight properties, it is considered preferable to use feathers from right or left wings only in each shuttlecock, and not mix feathers from different wings, as the feathers from different wings are shaped differently.\[7\]\[8\]

### 羽毛或合成材料

The feathers are brittle; shuttlecocks break easily and often need to be replaced several times during a game. For this reason, synthetic shuttlecocks have been developed that replace the feathers with a plastic skirt. Players often refer to synthetic shuttlecocks as *plastics* and feathered shuttlecocks as *feathers*.

Feather shuttles need to be properly humidified for at least 4 hours prior to play in order to fly the correct distance at the proper speed and to last longer. Properly humidified feathers flex during play, enhancing the shuttle's speed change and durability. Dry feathers are brittle and break easily, causing the shuttle to wobble. Saturated feathers are 'mushy', making the feather cone narrow too much when strongly hit, which causes the shuttle to fly overly far and fast. Typically a humidification box is used, or a small moist sponge is inserted in the feather end of the closed shuttle tube container, avoiding any water contact with the cork of the shuttle. Shuttles are tested prior to play to make sure they fly true and at the proper speed, and cover the proper distance. Different weights of shuttles are used to compensate for local atmospheric conditions. Both humidity and height above sea level affect shuttle flight. World Badminton Federation Rules say the shuttle should reach the far doubles service line plus or minus half the width of the tram. According to manufacturers proper shuttle will generally travel from the back line of the court to just short of the long doubles service line on the opposite side of the net, with a full underhand hit from an average player.\[9\]

The cost of good quality feathers is similar to that of good quality plastics, but plastics are far more durable, typically lasting many matches without any impairment to their flight. Shuttles are easily damaged and should be replaced every three or four games, and sooner if they are damaged and do not fly straight. This interferes with the game, as the impairment on the flight of the shuttle may misdirect the direction of the shuttlecock.

Most experienced and skillful players greatly prefer feathers, and serious tournaments or leagues are always played using feather shuttlecocks of the highest quality.\[10\]

The playing characteristics of plastics and feathers are substantially different. Plastics fly more slowly on initial impact, but slow down less towards the end of their flight. While feathers tend to drop straight down on a clear shot, plastics never quite return to a straight drop, falling more on a diagonal. Feather shuttles may come off the strings at speeds in excess of 320 km/h (200 mph) but slow down faster as they drop.

**拉文納的聖亞博那** ()
是一名[敘利亞](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/敘利亞 "wikilink")[聖人](../Page/基督教聖人.md "wikilink")，在中這樣描繪他：“教會傳統上，這位[主教](../Page/主教.md "wikilink")，在眾多民族中傳播[基督](../Page/基督.md "wikilink")深不可測的財富的同時，他作為一名好牧人引領了他的羊群，並以自己光榮的殉道榮耀了[拉文納](../Page/拉文納.md "wikilink")以及克拉塞的教會。”\[1\]

聖亞博那的瞻禮日於7月20日慶祝。\[2\]

## 生平

根據教會傳統，聖亞博那是二世紀時，東方[敘利亞](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/叙利亚_\(罗马行省\) "wikilink")[安條克的一位](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/安條克 "wikilink")[司鐸](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/司鐸 "wikilink")。他向西方傳播[基督](../Page/基督.md "wikilink")[福音](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/福音 "wikilink")，被升任為[拉文納](../Page/拉文納.md "wikilink")的首任主教，並領導拉文納附近克拉塞教會。他長期受到迫害，他和基督徒信眾在[羅馬皇帝](../Page/羅馬皇帝.md "wikilink")[韦斯巴芗](../Page/韦斯巴芗.md "wikilink")的迫害中（或是[尼祿](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/尼祿 "wikilink")）被放逐。他在途中被人認出，被逮捕後被劍刺死殉道。數個世紀後，他顯現在的神視中。

而另外的傳說則稱他於[瓦伦斯](../Page/瓦伦斯.md "wikilink")皇帝執政時殉道。

20世紀的 *天主教百科全書* 依據教會傳統這樣描述他：

> He was made Bishop of Ravenna, Italy, by Saint Peter himself. The
> miracles he wrought there soon attracted official attention, for they
> and his preaching won many converts to the Faith, while at the same
> time bringing upon him the fury of the idolaters, who beat him cruelly
> and drove him from the city. He was found half-dead on the seashore,
> and kept in concealment by the Christians, but was captured again and
> compelled to walk on burning coals and a second time expelled. But he
> remained in the vicinity, and continued his work of evangelization. We
> find him then journeying in the [Roman
> province](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province "wikilink") of
> [Aemilia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aemilia_\(province\) "wikilink")
> \[in Italy\]. A third time he returned to Ravenna. Again he was
> captured, hacked with knives, had scalding water poured over his
> wounds, was beaten in the mouth with stones because he persisted in
> preaching, and was flung into a horrible dungeon, loaded with chains,
> to starve to death; but after four days he was put on board a ship and
> sent to Greece. There the same course of preachings, miracles and
> sufferings continued; and when his very presence caused the oracles to
> be silent, he was, after a cruel beating, sent back to Italy. All this
> continued for three years, and a fourth time he returned to Ravenna.
> By this time
> [Vespasian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian "wikilink") was
> Emperor, and he, in answer to the complaints of the pagans, issued a
> decree of banishment against the Christians. Apollinaris was kept
> concealed for some time, but as he was passing out of the gates of the
> city, was set upon and savagely beaten, probably at
> [Classis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classis "wikilink"), a suburb,
> but he lived for seven days, foretelling meantime that the
> persecutions would increase, but that the Church would ultimately
> triumph. It is not certain what was his native place, though it was
> probably Antioch. Nor is it sure that he was one of the seventy-two
> disciples of Christ, as has been suggested. The precise date of his
> consecration cannot be ascertained, but he was Bishop of Ravenna for
> twenty-six years.\[3\]

由於地區的二世紀基督教文獻顯示，該地區基督教歷史可追溯到很早的年份，拉文納第十二任主教Severus參加過公元343年召開的。因此，學者們估計聖亞博那大概最晚於二世紀末殉道，有可能在皇帝[塞普蒂米乌斯·塞维鲁執政時殉道](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/塞普蒂米乌斯·塞维鲁 "wikilink")。

《**致女皇陛下臣民通函**》由[英國駐華商務總監](../Page/英國駐華商務總監.md "wikilink")[查理·義律於](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/查理·義律 "wikilink")1841年1月20日發表，宣稱與清政府欽差[琦善就](../Page/琦善.md "wikilink")[第一次鴉片戰爭](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/第一次鴉片戰爭 "wikilink")「達成了初步協議」。

英軍於[香港仔登陸](../Page/香港仔.md "wikilink")，從[蜑民](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/蜑民 "wikilink")[陳群以](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/陳群 "wikilink")[蜑家話回答中得知](../Page/蜑家話.md "wikilink")「Hong
Kong」的名稱，並沿用至今。此協議包含「割讓香港島和海港給英國」，及後但由於清廷及英國政經界分別認為「有辱國體」及獲利太少，故雙方不承認《[穿鼻草約](../Page/穿鼻草約.md "wikilink")》存在。
直至1842年，清朝在[第一次鴉片戰爭中被英国打敗](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/第一次鴉片戰爭 "wikilink")，並於翌年與英國簽訂《[南京條約](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/南京條約 "wikilink")》，將香港島連同鄰近的鴨脷洲才正式永久割讓與英國。
1860年清廷於[第二次鴉片戰爭](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/第二次鴉片戰爭 "wikilink")（即英法聯軍之役）再敗給英法聯軍，簽下《[北京條約](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/北京條約 "wikilink")》，一同永久割讓[九龍半島南部連同鄰近的](../Page/九龍.md "wikilink")[昂船洲給英國](../Page/昂船洲.md "wikilink")。當時在九龍半島上的新邊界只用矮矮的鐵絲網分割，位置就在今日的[界限街](../Page/界限街.md "wikilink")。1898年，英國通過與清廷簽訂《[中英展拓香港界址專條](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中英展拓香港界址專條 "wikilink")》及其他一系列租借條約，租借九龍半島北部、新界和鄰近的兩百多個離島，但九龍寨城除外，租期99年。這一系列的租借和割讓，形成了今日香港的邊界。

>         British crown. All just charges and duties to the empire upon
>         the commerce carried on there to be paid as if the trade were
>         conducted at Whampoa.
>         2\. An indemnity to the British government of six millions of
>         dollars, one million payable at once, and the remainder in
>         equal annual instalments, ending in 1846.
>         3\. Direct official intercourse between the countries upon an

>         4\. The trade of the port of Canton to be opened within ten
>         days after the Chinese new year, and to be carried on at
>         Whampoa till further arrangements are practicable at the new
>         settlement.
>
> Details remain matter of negotiation.

> for the advantage of British ships and merchants, and he is only
> performing his duty in offering the protection of the British flag to
> the subjects, citizens, and ships of foreign powers that may resort to
> her Majesty's possession.
> Pending her Majesty's further pleasure, there will be no port or other
> changes to the British government.
> The Plenipotentiary now permits himself to make a few general
> observations.
> The oblivion of past and redressed injuries will follow naturally from
> the right feeling of the Queen's subjects. Indeed, it should be
> remembered that no extent of modification resulting only from
> political intervention can be efficacious in the steady improvement of
> our condition, unless it be systematically seconded by conciliatory
> treatment of the people and becoming deference for the institutions
> and government of the country, upon the threshold of which we are
> about to be established.
> The Plenipotentiary can only presume to advert very briefly to the
> zeal and wisdom of the Commander of the expedition to China; and to
> that rare union of ardour, patience, and forbearance, which has
> distinguished the officers and forces of all arms at all points of
> occupation and operation.
> He is well assured the British community will sympathize cordially
> with him in their sentiments of lasting respect for his Excellency and
> the whole force, which he is ashamed to express in such inadequate
> language.
> He cannot conclude without declaring that next to these causes, the
> peaceful adjustment of difficulties must be ascribed to the scrupulous
> good faith of the very eminent person with whom negotiations are still
> pending.

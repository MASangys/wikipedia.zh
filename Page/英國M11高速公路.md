**M11高速公路**是英國一條約55英里（88.5公里）長的高速公路，從南伍德福德的[北圓路](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/北圓路_\(英國\) "wikilink")（A406）向北延伸至英格蘭劍橋西北的[A14號公路](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/A14公路_\(英國\) "wikilink")。 最初該高速公路是在1915年提出的，後來在1960年代考慮了各種計劃，並於1975年至1980年之間進行了最終建設。該高速公路分階段開放，第一階段（在7號和8號交界處之間）於1975年6月開放，完整的高速公路於1980年2月全面開始運作。從南伍德福德（South Woodford）到吉爾頓（Girton），該高速公路可直達大型新市鎮[哈洛](../Page/哈洛.md "wikilink")（Harlow）和[劍橋市](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/劍橋市 "wikilink")。自2002年以來，該高速公路極大地改善了前往[倫敦斯坦斯特德機場的交通](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/倫敦斯坦斯特德機場 "wikilink") 。

## 路線

The M11 starts in [South Woodford](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Woodford "wikilink") in northeast London at Junction 4, with the [North Circular](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Circular "wikilink") (A406), it then heads [NNE](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/boxing_the_compass "wikilink"), passing east of [Loughton](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughton "wikilink") and [Theydon Bois](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theydon_Bois "wikilink") as well as [Epping Forest](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epping_Forest "wikilink"), meeting the [M25](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/M25_motorway "wikilink") motorway at Junction 6, and then veering approximately north, passing to the east of [Harlow](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow "wikilink"). The M11 gives access to [Bishop's Stortford](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop's_Stortford "wikilink") and the motorway's only [service station](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birchanger_Green_services "wikilink") via Junction 8. This is followed immediately by the recently constructed Junction 8A, which provides a free-flow link to the improved [A120](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/A120_road "wikilink") that links to [Stansted Airport](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport "wikilink"). The M11 then traverses part of [Cambridgeshire](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire "wikilink"), meeting a spur for the [A11](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/A11_road_\(England\) "wikilink") at Junction 9, and then finally ends at Junction 14, the busy Girton Interchange, with the road continuing through the junction and becoming the [A14](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/A14_road_\(England\) "wikilink"), which continues the route on to [Huntingdon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingdon "wikilink") and the north.

The motorway starts with two lanes southbound and three northbound; then, north of [Woodford Bridge](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodford_Bridge "wikilink"), both directions have three lanes, a layout that continues up to Junction 8A, except for a brief two-lane section at Junction 6, beneath the M25. From Junction 8 the motorway has two lanes in both directions all the way to Junction 14 where the motorway terminates. The motorway is illuminated at the southern terminus near Junction 4, at Junction 6 (the M25 interchange), and also at the approach to Junction 8/8A (Stansted Airport/Bishop's Stortford), and then at the northern terminus at Junction 14, for the A14. All four of these sections use modern [high pressure sodium](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_vapor_lamp "wikilink") (SON) lighting. The older, yellow, low-pressure sodium (SOX) lighting originally used at junctions 4 and 6 was replaced in 2005. The numbering of the M11 junctions is unusual, as 1–3 are neither used nor shared with another road (see 'History' section). This means that southbound drivers reaching the end of the M11 have to use the A12 & A11 to reach central London.

## 歷史

### 計劃案

[Motorway_M11_Cambridge.JPG](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Motorway_M11_Cambridge.JPG "fig:Motorway_M11_Cambridge.JPG")\]\] Plans for an 'Eastern Avenue' in London had been proposed as early as 1915, and the Eastern Avenue Extension was causing local concern in Leyton and Hackney during the late 1950s and early 1960s.\[1\] It was opposed by a number of groups, including the Hackney Society\[2\] and local residents as represented by their member of parliament in 1962.\[3\]

By 1966, the [Ministry of Transport](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport "wikilink") was planning a longer road and for it to be partly motorway. The first version had a mid-south section, to follow a [River Lea](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Lea "wikilink") route, starting at [Angel](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel,_London "wikilink") southwest of [Dalston](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalston "wikilink"), heading northeast then north, taking land by the river in [Walthamstow](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walthamstow "wikilink"), [Chingford](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chingford "wikilink") and [Waltham Cross](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltham_Cross "wikilink"), and meeting the built road alignment of today north of [Harlow](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow "wikilink"). The road from South Woodford to [Islington](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islington "wikilink") would have been designated as the M12. The route was in planning stages with several options, with differences between the plans preferred by the Greater London Council and the Ministry of Transport\[4\] – a different version called for this 'Eastern Avenue' to run more east–west alongside the [Regent's Canal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent's_Canal "wikilink") and the north side of [Victoria Park](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park,_East_London "wikilink"), [Hackney Wick](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackney_Wick "wikilink"), where it would have connected to the [North Cross](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Cross_Route "wikilink") and [East Cross Routes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Cross_Route "wikilink") at the northeast corner of an [inner ringway](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringway_1 "wikilink") identified by the [London Ringways](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Ringways "wikilink"){{\#tag:ref|An expressway inner circular, referred to as the *London Motorway Box*|group= n}} plan.\[5\]

There were three proposed routes from the inner to [outer ringway](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringway_2 "wikilink") (North Circular) at the base of the current M11 and it is unclear which one was favoured.\[6\]

Under one scheme, south of [South Woodford](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Woodford "wikilink") a connection would have been made with the western end of a proposed "[M12](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/M12_motorway "wikilink")" towards [Colchester](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchester "wikilink"). These proposals also made the case for an [M15 motorway](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/M15_motorway_\(Great_Britain\) "wikilink") for the Ringway 2, a major upgrade of the [North Circular Road](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Circular_Road "wikilink") to typical motorway standard. When the southern end of the current M11 ended here, space was provided between the two carriageways to enable an offshoot of 'the M12' to merge from the southwest: junctions 1, 2 and 3 were reserved for this additional inner London section. Part of the unbuilt route of a southern section of the M11 is seen from a sliproad from the North Circular to the M11 which travels over a bridge over bare land.

It was announced in March 1975 that from Junction 8 (Bishops Stortford/Stansted exit) to the northern terminus, (thus including the Cambridge western bypass) would not be "constructed to M1 standard".\[7\] This was another way of stating that, following a change in government policy, this section would comprise two rather than three lanes in each direction.\[8\]

### 追加公路

The **M11 Link Road**, or more formally 'A12 Hackney to M11 link road' (in fact leading to the North Circular) was constructed during the 1990s from [Hackney Wick](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackney_Wick "wikilink") by [Victoria Park](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park,_East_London "wikilink") to the Redbridge Roundabout—the [Wanstead](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanstead "wikilink") interchange of the North Circular—and was opened in 1999{{\#tag:ref|as the A12 which then continues to the east to [Chelmsford](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelmsford "wikilink") and [Colchester](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchester "wikilink")|group= n}}.\[9\] The route of this road, which followed a similar route to one of the initial proposals\[10\] resulted in the protracted [M11 link road protest](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/M11_link_road_protest "wikilink") between 1993 and 1995, one of a spate of major [UK road protests](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_protest_\(UK\) "wikilink") under the [Major ministry](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Major_ministry "wikilink").

### 隨後失敗與暫停的提案

#### Junction 5

An official plan to add north-facing connections at Junction 5 in [Debden](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debden,_Epping_Forest "wikilink"), [Loughton](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughton "wikilink") was abandoned in 1998.\[11\]

#### Junctions 6 to 8

The Highways Agency tabled proposals to upgrade the M11, between junction 6 and 8, from three lanes plus hard shoulder to four each way with an estimated cost of £698 million given in 2007.\[12\] A number of public consultations were made throughout 2007\[13\] and although efforts were made to limit environmental damage the scheme would cause disruption and loss of habitat to three designated ecological areas and a [Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest "wikilink") at Gernon Bushes.\[14\][Maps](https://web.archive.org/web/20081201142705/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/16633.aspx) of the proposal and previously discounted options were published by the Highways Agency. Plans were abandoned in March 2009 when the [Secretary of State for Transport](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport "wikilink") announced that no changes would be made to this section of motorway before 2021.\[15\]

### 建設

The motorway was opened in stages. The stretch between Junctions 7 and 8 opened in 1975, and that between Junctions 4 and 7 in 1977.{{\#tag:ref|Constructed to the south of the not-yet built M25 interchange by [W. & C. French Engineering](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kier_Group "wikilink"), and to its north by Dowsett Engineering Construction Ltd of [Harrogate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrogate "wikilink")\[16\]|group= n}} The stretch from Junctions 8 to 9 opened in 1979; that between Junctions 9 and 14 in 1980; and the full length becoming fully operational in February 1980.\[17\]\[18\]

Budgets were tight during the 1970s when the road was built, so the [road surface](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavement_\(material\) "wikilink") was of unsurfaced [concrete](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/concrete "wikilink") between Junction 14 and a point approximately  to the south of Junction 7. South of this stretch, where the road runs on soft ground close to the [River Roding](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Roding "wikilink"), concrete was considered unsuitable owing to the looseness of the [subsoil](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/subsoil "wikilink") and the consequent risk of random cracking, so the surface here was of [tarmac](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphalt_concrete "wikilink") from the start.

## 服務

The motorway's first, and only, service station, Birchanger Green Services at Junction 8, opened in 1996. The services also serve the [A120](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/A120_road "wikilink"), a major high-speed dual-carriageway road, running from Junction 8A to the eastern fringe of [Braintree](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braintree,_Essex "wikilink"), it continues on to [Colchester](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchester "wikilink") as a busy single-carriageway road.\[19\]

There had been plans for a service station on the motorway as long ago as 1969, named [Chigwell](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chigwell "wikilink"), between that village and [Loughton](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughton "wikilink"), which led to the construction of spur roads and a restricted lorry park; during the [London Olympics 2012](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympics_2012 "wikilink") these were used as a works unit.\[20\] The plans for a service station at this site were officially dropped in 1980.\[21\]

## 運轉

From the late 1990s onward, the concrete surface that had greatly degraded was progressively replaced with standard layers of tarmac, and [drainage](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/drainage "wikilink") improvements were implemented at the same time. This work was completed in June 2008.

Junction 8A for the A120 road and Stansted Airport opened in December 2002.

## 申請過的發展計劃

By way of complementary plans for [proposed expansion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stansted_Airport#Proposed_expansion "wikilink") of [Stansted Airport](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport "wikilink"), the [Highways Agency](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highways_Agency "wikilink") collaborated with [BAA](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA_Limited "wikilink") on improvements to transport access to the airport\[22\] including two proposals for the M11, one of which has been deemed unnecessary, Junctions 6–8, see above and the other of which, including spur road and junction additions may be approved by the government if Stansted expansion takes place.\[23\]

### M11 and A120 Interchange – Stansted Generation 2 Airport Access

A joint scheme involving works on junctions on the M11 and [A120](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/A120_road "wikilink"). This scheme was part of an aborted plan to add a second runway to Stansted Airport. It proposed changes to junction 8 of the M11 with the creation of junction 8B, linked to and situated just north of junction 8/8A and the creation of a new junction on the A120, to provide additional rapid access to the expanded airport.\[24\] The scheme was given an estimated cost of £131 million in May 2008.\[25\] Throughout 2007 a number of public consultations and exhibitions were held. Findings from these showed that although the public had several concerns regarding environmental impact 57% of attendees agreed the scheme would be necessary if the Stansted Airport expansion proceeded.\[26\] Following the public consultation, the Preferred Route was published on 5 March 2008 and the Draft Orders on 27 March 2008. A pre-public inquiry meeting took place on 10 November 2008\[27\] with a public inquiry due in April 2009.\[28\] However, this was delayed until further notice following BAA's appeal against the [March 2009 ruling](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA_Limited#Competition "wikilink") of the Competition Commission and the proposal lapsed when the application for a second runway was withdrawn by BAA in 2010.\[29\]\[30\]

## 事件

### 墜機

In June 2002, a brake failure on an [Aero L-39 Albatross](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aero_L-39 "wikilink") landing at the [Imperial War Museum's Duxford Aerodrome](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_War_Museum_Duxford "wikilink") caused the plane to run off the end of the runway and down the embankment on to the motorway. The trainee pilot was killed when he [ejected](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_seat "wikilink") from ground level but the instructor survived the accident and no vehicles on the motorway were involved.\[31\] The main runway at Duxford had been shortened in 1977 from  to  when the motorway was built. More recently even though Duxford already met all licensing requirements, the declared length was reduced to  to increase safety further than existing measures.\[32\]\[33\]

### 雪暴

In January 2003 thousands of motorists became stranded on "White Friday" for up to 20 hours between junctions 7 and 9 during a snowstorm.\[34\]

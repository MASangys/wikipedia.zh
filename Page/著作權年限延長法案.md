[右](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tom_Bell's_graph_showing_extension_of_U.S._copyright_term_over_time.svg "fig:右") **《著作權年限延長法案》** (**CTEA**)是1998年的延長在[美國的](../Page/美国.md "wikilink")[著作權條款](../Page/美国版权法.md "wikilink")。 除了這個法案之外，還有多個延長著作權年限的法案。<ref>

根據1976年著作權法，[著作權](../Page/著作權.md "wikilink")將會持續到作者去世後再加上50年，或者團體作者則為75年。1976年的法案另外將1978年以前尚未進入公有領域的作品的年限從28年延長到47年，使之總年限達75年。 \[1\]

而1998年的法案，則將上述的1976年著作權法案的年限延長至作者去世後再加上70年，並且將團體作者的著作權年限延長至「創作後120年」或「公開發表後95年」兩者之間較短者。 <ref>

</ref>1978年1月1日之前發表的作品，也在此法案增加了20年，總計到95年。

這項法律又稱**桑尼·波諾著作權年限延長法案**、**桑尼·波諾法案**、或（帶嘲諷性質地）稱它為**[米老鼠](../Page/米老鼠.md "wikilink")保護法案。**法案有效地「凍結」原本舊有即將進入美國公有領域的推進年限。根據這道法案，美國於1923年或之後的創作，受到這份法案的著作權保護，將不會進入公有領域直到直到2019年1月1日之後。米老鼠首次於1928年出現，所以除非著作權所有者決定提前將其發佈到公有領域，否則將會在2024年\[2\]或之後（得從跟米老鼠相關的不同創作公開發表的日期而定）才會成為在公有領域的作品，除非版权所有者在此之前将其发布到公共领域。跟歐盟的著作權擴展立法有差異的是，桑尼·波諾法案並沒有恢復已經過期的作品之著作權保護。该法确实扩大了已经受版权保护的作品的保护条款，并在此意义上具有追溯力。 但是，在1978年1月1日之前创作的作品，直到最近才出版或注册为版权，将在特殊部分（ 中提及。 ）并可能直到2047年底持續受保护。该法案成了1998年10月27日的 。

## 立法背景

依據1886年的國際[伯尔尼保护文学和艺术作品公约](../Page/伯尔尼保护文学和艺术作品公约.md "wikilink")（簡稱伯恩公約），簽署公約的國家被要求提供對作者至少死後加上五十年的著作權保護。除此之外，簽署國也可以提供比死後五十年更長的保護年限。直到1989年3月1日[美國正式批准伯恩公約之後](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美國 "wikilink")，此公約才在[美國具約束力](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美國 "wikilink")。但是在此之前，美國已經於提供了伯恩公約所規範的著作權最短所需年限。

在美國加入了伯恩公約之後，部分著作權的既得利益者成功地[遊說](../Page/游说集团.md "wikilink")[美国国会](../Page/美国国会.md "wikilink")再一次延長著作權的年限，讓美國的保護年限能夠跟[歐洲的規範相同](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/歐洲 "wikilink")。自從1993年生效後，[欧洲联盟](../Page/欧洲联盟.md "wikilink")的成員國便將著作權保護的年限延長至作者死後加上七十年。

為了紀念去世的國會議員，上述延長著作權年限的法案便以他的姓名為法案名稱。桑尼·波諾在法案正式成為通過的九個月前過世；他之前曾經是一個類似法案的十二名贊助者之一。

眾議院的議員對於飯店、酒吧的老闆抱持同情，這些企業主對於[美國作曲家、作家、和發行商協會（ASCAP）以及](../Page/美国作曲家、作家和发行商协会.md "wikilink")[BMI公司的授權方式感到憤恨不平](../Page/廣播音樂公司.md "wikilink")，這差點讓法案無法通過。最後，桑尼·波諾法案被修改，納入，免除小型單位需要申請公共表演授權才能播放音樂的限制。\[3\]

美國國會兩院都以[口头表决通過此法案](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/口头表决 "wikilink")，為美國聯邦公法第105-298法案\[4\]\[5\][克林頓總統在](../Page/比尔·克林顿.md "wikilink")1998年10月27日簽署了桑尼·波諾著作權年限延長法案。\[6\]

## 政治氛圍

### 參議院報告 104-315

參議院報告\[7\]提供了為何要通過著作權延長法律的原因。原本這是在1995年的著作權年限延長法案的提案背景中所撰寫。\[8\]

報告的作者們相信延展著作權的保護年限，將能夠幫助美國在國外保護他們的創作更多的保護，而因為提供創作者更多獨享的權益也能提供更多誘因來數位化與保存其作品。此報告也納入了與兩位參議員的非主流意見，他們認為延長年限會是藉由剝奪大眾使用作品而使現有著作權擁有者的一筆意外之財。

### 支持方

自1990年始，[华特迪士尼公司](../Page/华特迪士尼公司.md "wikilink")就在倡議著作權年限的延長。這個的立法延後了最早的幾部[米老鼠](../Page/米老鼠.md "wikilink")電影進入公眾領域的年限，這也讓此法案有了「米老鼠保護法案」的謔稱。

除了迪士尼之外，加州的國會議員（桑尼·波諾之妻，也是桑尼過世後的議員職務繼任者），還有作曲家[乔治·格什温](../Page/乔治·格什温.md "wikilink")著作權的擁有者也支持這個法案。瑪莉·波諾曾在[美國眾議院的公開演講說道](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美國眾議院 "wikilink")：

其他支持贊成波諾法案的遊說團體還有[華納媒體](../Page/華納媒體.md "wikilink")、[环球影业](../Page/环球影业.md "wikilink")、[維亞康姆](../Page/維亞康姆.md "wikilink")、主流的職業運動聯盟（[美國橄欖球聯盟（NFL）](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/國家美式橄欖球聯盟 "wikilink")、[NBA](../Page/NBA.md "wikilink")、[國家曲棍球聯盟（NHL）](../Page/國家冰球聯盟.md "wikilink")、[大聯盟（MLB）](../Page/美國職業棒球大聯盟.md "wikilink")）、以及遇害歌手[莎麗娜](../Page/莎麗娜.md "wikilink")的家人。

波諾法案的擁護者指出，自從國會通過原本後，人類的[預期壽命已經大幅的增長](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/預期壽命 "wikilink")，故修法是必要的。\[9\]，美國和歐洲的著作權年限的差異將會對[演藝界](../Page/演藝界.md "wikilink")的國際運作起負面的影響\[10\]\[11\]，他們也認為有些創作是需要更長期的著作權專享的情形下才會有人願意進行，現行的年限並不足。他們也聲稱對美國而言有著作權的作品之利潤是佔美國很重要的收入\[12\]\[13\]，像是[VHS](../Page/VHS.md "wikilink")、[DVD](../Page/數碼多功能影音光碟.md "wikilink")、[有线电视](../Page/有线电视.md "wikilink")、[衛星電視也已經增進了電影和電視劇的價值與商業生命](../Page/人造衛星.md "wikilink")。\[14\]

Proponents contend that Congress has the power to pass whatever copyright term it wants because the language "To promote the progress of science and useful arts" in the United States Constitution is not a substantive limitation on the powers of Congress, leaving the sole restriction that copyrights must only last for "limited times." However, in what respect the granted time must be limited has never been determined, thus arguably even an absurdly long, yet finite, duration would still be a valid *limited time* according to the letter of the Constitution as long as Congress was ostensibly setting this limit to promote the progress of science and useful arts. This was one of the arguments that prevailed in the ** case, when the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the CTEA. It is also pointed out by proponents that the extension did not prevent all works from going in the public domain. They note that the 1976 Copyright Act established that [unpublished](../Page/出版物.md "wikilink") works created before 1978 would still begin entering the public domain January 1, 2003 (Known author: life of the author plus 70 years; anonymous/pseudoanonymous/unknown author/works-for-hire: 120 years from creation), and that the provision remained unaffected by the 1998 extension.\[15\] They also claim that Congress has actually increased the scope of the public domain since, for the first time, unpublished works will enter the public domain.\[16\]

Proponents believe that copyright encourages progress in the arts. With an extension of copyright, future artists have to create something original, rather than reuse old work, however, had the act been in place in the 1960s, it is unlikely that [Andy Warhol](../Page/安迪·沃荷.md "wikilink") would have been able to sell or even exhibit any of his work, since it all incorporated previously copyrighted material. Proponents contend that it is more important to encourage all creators to make new works instead of just copyright holders.\[17\]

Proponents say that copyright better preserves intellectual property like movies, music and television shows.\[18\]\[19\] One example given is the case of the classic film *[It's a Wonderful Life](../Page/風雲人物.md "wikilink")*.\[20\] Before  and  (who owned the motion picture rights to the short story and the music even after the film itself became public domain) began to assert their rights to the film, various local TV stations and cable networks broadcast the film endlessly. As *[New York Times](../Page/纽约时报.md "wikilink")* reporter Bill Carter put it: "the film's currency was being devalued."\[21\]

Many different versions of the film were made and most if not all were in horrible condition.\[22\] After underlying rights to the film were enforced, it was given a high quality restoration that was hailed by critics. In addition, proponents note that once a work falls into the public domain there is no guarantee that the work will be more widely available or cheaper. Suggesting that quality copies of public domain works are not widely available, they argue that one reason for a lack of availability may be due to publishers' reluctance to publish a work that is in the public domain for fear that they will not be able to recoup their investment or earn enough profit.\[23\]

Proponents reject the idea that only works in the public domain can provide artistic inspiration. They note that opponents fail to take into account that copyright applies only to expressions of ideas and not the ideas themselves.\[24\] Thus artists are free to get ideas from copyrighted works as long as they do not [infringe](../Page/盗版.md "wikilink"). Borrowing ideas and such are common in film, TV and music even with copyrighted works (see **,  and [stock character](../Page/定型角色.md "wikilink")). Works such as [parody](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/戲仿 "wikilink") benefit from [fair use](../Page/合理使用.md "wikilink").

Proponents also question the idea that extended copyright is "corporate welfare." They state that many opponents also have a stake in the case, claiming that those arguing against copyright term extension are mostly businesses that depend on distributing films and videos that have lost their copyright.\[25\]

One argument against the CTEA is focused on the [First Amendment](../Page/美国宪法第一修正案.md "wikilink"). In **, however, the court explained how a copyright "respects and adequately safeguards the [freedom of speech](../Page/言論自由.md "wikilink") protected by the [First Amendment](../Page/美国宪法第一修正案.md "wikilink")."\[26\] In following this approach, courts have held that copyrights are "categorically immune from challenges under the [First Amendment](../Page/美国宪法第一修正案.md "wikilink")."\[27\]

### 反對方

Critics of the CTEA argue that it was never the original intention for copyright protection to be extended in the United States. Attorney [Jenny L. Dixon](https://www.robbinsarroyo.com/jenny-l-dixon/) mentions that "the United States has always viewed copyright primarily as a vehicle for achieving social benefit based on the belief that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance the public welfare;"\[28\] however, "the U.S. does not consider copyright as a 'natural right.'"\[29\] Dixon continues that with increased extensions on copyright protections, authors receive the benefits, while the public have more difficulty accessing these works, weakening public domain.\[30\] One such extension Dixon mentions is the protection of a copyrighted work for the author's life followed by two generations, which opponents argue that there is no legislation nor intention for this copyright protection.\[31\] "These constitutionally-grounded arguments 'for limitations on proprietary rights' are being rejected time and time again."\[32\]

, a law professor, led an effort to try to prevent the CTEA from being passed. He testified before the Committees on the Judiciary arguing "that extending the term of copyright protection would impose substantial costs on the United States general public without supplying any public benefit. The extension bills represent a fundamental departure from the United States philosophy that intellectual property legislation serve a public purpose."\[33\]

An editorial in *[The New York Times](../Page/纽约时报.md "wikilink")* argued against the copyright extension on February 21, 1998. The article stated "When Senator Hatch laments that [George Gershwin](../Page/乔治·格什温.md "wikilink")'s *[Rhapsody in Blue](../Page/藍色狂想曲.md "wikilink")* will soon 'fall into the public domain,' he makes the public domain sound like a dark abyss where songs go, never to be heard again. In fact, when a work enters the public domain it means the public can afford to use it freely, to give it new currency."\[34\]

Opponents of the *Bono Act* consider the legislation to be  and have  to have it declared , claiming that such an act is not "necessary and proper" to accomplishing the Constitution's stated purpose of "promot\[ing\] the progress of science and useful arts".\[35\] They argue that most works bring most of the profits during the first few years and are pushed off the market by the publishers thereafter. Thus there is little economic incentive in extending the terms of copyrights except for the few owners of franchises that are wildly successful, such as Disney. They also point out that the [Tenth Amendment](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美國憲法第十修正案 "wikilink") can be construed as placing limits on the powers that Congress can gain from a treaty. More directly, they see two successive terms of approximately 20 years each (the  and the Bono Act) as the beginning of a "slippery slope" toward a  term that nullifies the intended effect and violates the spirit of the "for limited times" language of the [United States Constitution, Article I](../Page/美国宪法第一条.md "wikilink"), section 8, clause 8.\[36\]

Some opponents have questioned the proponents' life expectancy argument, making the comparison between the growth of copyright terms and the term of patents in relation to the growth of life expectancies. Life expectancies have risen from about 35 years in 1800 \[37\] to 77.6 years in 2002.\[38\] While copyright terms have increased threefold, from only 28 years total (under the ), life expectancies have roughly doubled. Moreover, life expectancy statistics are skewed due to historically high infant mortality rates. Correcting for infant mortality, life expectancy has only increased by fifteen years between 1850 and 2000.\[39\] In addition, copyright terms have increased significantly since the 1790 act, but [patent](../Page/专利.md "wikilink") terms have not been extended in parallel, with 20-year terms of protection remaining the (presumably under the laws) adequate compensation for innovation in a technical field.\[40\] Seventeen prominent economists, including [Kenneth Arrow](../Page/肯尼斯·阿罗.md "wikilink"), [Ronald Coase](../Page/罗纳德·科斯.md "wikilink"), and [Milton Friedman](../Page/米爾頓·佛利民.md "wikilink"), submitted an [amicus brief](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/法院之友 "wikilink") opposing the bill when it was challenged in court. They argued that the [discounted](../Page/贴现.md "wikilink") [present value](../Page/現值.md "wikilink") of the extension was only a 1% increase for newly created works, while the increase in [transaction costs](../Page/交易成本.md "wikilink") created by extending the terms of old works would be very large and without any [marginal](../Page/边际主义.md "wikilink") benefit.\[41\] According to [Lawrence Lessig](../Page/勞倫斯·雷席格.md "wikilink"), when asked to sign the brief, Friedman had originally insisted that "the word 'no-brainer' \[appear\] in it somewhere," but still agreed to sign it even though his condition was not met.\[42\]

Another argument against the CTEA is focused on the [First Amendment](../Page/美国宪法第一修正案.md "wikilink") "because of the prospective and retrospective application of the CTEA."\[43\] The plaintiffs in ** believed that "the CTEA failed to sustain the intermediate level of scrutiny test afforded by the [First Amendment](../Page/美国宪法第一修正案.md "wikilink") because the government did not have an 'important' interest to justify withholding speech."\[44\]

Opponents also argue that the Act encourages "offshore production." For example, derivative works could be created outside the United States in areas where copyright would have expired, and that US law would prohibit these works to US residents. For example, a movie of Mickey Mouse playing with a computer could be legally created in Russia, but the movie would be refused admission for importation by US Customs because of copyright, resulting in a deprivation to American children. Similarly, the first [Winnie-the-Pooh](../Page/小熊維尼.md "wikilink") book was published in 1926 and would have been public domain in 2001.\[45\]\[46\]

Opponents identify another possible harm from copyright extension: loss of productive value of private collections of copyrighted works. A person who collected copyrighted works that would soon "go out of copyright," intending to re-release them on copyright expiration, lost the use of his capital expenditures for an additional 20 years when the Bono Act passed. This is part of the underlying argument in **.\[47\] The Bono Act is thus perceived to add an instability to commerce and investment, areas which have a better legal theoretical basis than intellectual property, whose theory is of quite recent development and is often criticized as being a corporate chimera. Conceivably, if one had made such an investment and then produced a derivative work (or perhaps even re-released the work *in ipse*), he could counter a suit made by the copyright holder by declaring that Congress had unconstitutionally made, [ex post facto](../Page/追溯法令.md "wikilink"), a restriction on the previously unrestricted.

questioned the proponents' argument that "new works would not be created", which implies that the goal of copyright is to make the creation of new works possible. However, the Framers of the United States Constitution evidently thought that unnecessary, instead restricting the goal of copyright to merely "promot\[ing\] the progress of science and useful arts". In fact, some works created under time-limited copyright would not be created under perpetual copyright because the creator of a distantly derivative work does not have the money and resources to find the owner of copyright in the original work and purchase a license, or the individual or privately held owner of copyright in the original work might refuse to license a use at any price (though a refusal to license may trigger a fair use safety valve). Thus they argue that a rich, continually replenished, public domain is necessary for continued artistic creation.\[48\]

### 1998年3月25日的眾議院辯論

The House debated the Copyright Term Extension Act (House Resolution 390) on March 25, 1998.\[49\] The term extension was almost completely supported, with only the mild criticism by  (Wisconsin) of "H.R. 2589 provides a very generous windfall to the entertainment industry by extending the term of copyright for an additional 20 years."\[50\] He suggested that it could be balanced by adding provisions from the  (H.R. 789). [Lloyd Doggett](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/羅伊德·道吉特 "wikilink") (Texas) called the 'Fairness in Music Licensing Act' the 'Music Theft Act' and claimed that it was a mechanism to "steal the intellectual property of thousands of small businesspeople who are song writers in this land."\[51\] The majority of subsequent debate was over Sensenbrenner's House Amendment 532\[52\] to the CTEA. This amendment was over details of allowing music from radio and television broadcasts in small businesses to be played without licensing fees. An amendment to Sensenbrenner's amendment was proposed by ,.\[53\] The key differences between Sensenbrenner's proposal and McCollum's amendment were 1) local arbitration versus court lawsuits in rate disagreements, 2) all retail businesses versus only restaurants and bars, 3) 3500 square feet of general public area versus  of gross area, 4) which music licensing societies it applied to (all versus ASCAP and BMI), and 5) freedom from vicarious liability for landlords and others leasing space versus no such provision.\[54\] After debate (and the first verse of American Pie\[55\]) the McCollum Amendment was rejected in by 259 to 150\[56\] and the Sensenbrenner amendment was passed by 297 to 112.\[57\] The Copyright Term Extension Act H.R. 2589 was passed.\[58\]

The term extension was supported for two key reasons. First, "copyright industries give us \[(the United States)\] one of our most significant trade surpluses." Second, the recently enacted legislation in the European Union had extended copyright there for 20 years, and so EU works would be protected for 20 years longer than US works if the US did not enact similar term extensions.  also stated that it was good for consumers since "When works are protected by copyright, they attract investors who can exploit the work for profit."\[59\] The term extension portion was supported by , , the [Motion Picture Association of America](../Page/美國電影協會.md "wikilink"), the Intellectual Property Law Section of the American Bar Association, the [Recording Industry Association of America](../Page/美國唱片業協會.md "wikilink"), , the  and others.\[60\]

## 後續爭議

### 法理違憲

Publishers and librarians, among others, brought a lawsuit, **, to obtain an injunction on enforcement of the act. Oral arguments were heard by the [U.S. Supreme Court](../Page/美国最高法院.md "wikilink") on October 9, 2002. On January 15, 2003 the court held the CTEA constitutional by a 7–2 decision.\[61\]

In 2003, the plaintiffs in the *Eldred* case began to shift their effort toward the U.S. Congress in support of a bill called the  that would make the provisions of the Bono Act apply only to copyrights that had been registered with the [Library of Congress](../Page/國會圖書館_\(美國\).md "wikilink").

### 實務測試

In 2012, law professors Christopher Buccafusco and Paul J. Heald performed tests of three key justifications of copyright extension, namely: that public domain works will be underutilized and less available, will be oversaturated by poor quality copies, and poor quality derivative works will harm the reputation of the original works. They compared works from the two decades surrounding 1923 made available as audiobooks. They found that copyrighted works were available at a significantly lower rate than public domain ones, found no evidence of overexploitation driving down the price of works, and that the quality of the audiobook recordings did not significantly affect the price people were willing to pay for the books in print.\[62\] Heald's later experiment analyzing a random sample of newly-posted works on [Amazon.com](../Page/亞馬遜公司.md "wikilink") revealed that public domain works from 1880 were posted at double the rate of copyrighted works from 1980.\[63\]

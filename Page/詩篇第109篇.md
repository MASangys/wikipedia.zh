**《诗篇》第109篇**
（在[通用希腊语](../Page/通用希腊语.md "wikilink")《[七十士译本](../Page/七十士译本.md "wikilink")》中被列为**第108篇**）是《[希伯来圣经](../Page/希伯来圣经.md "wikilink")·[诗篇](../Page/诗篇.md "wikilink")》中的一篇，有31节。作者是[大卫王](../Page/大卫王.md "wikilink")，交於伶長用。這诗篇是少數《诗篇》中記錄的詛咒。

第8节的“願他的年日短少，願別人得他的職分。”在[使徒行傳](../Page/使徒行傳.md "wikilink")1:16-26，使徒們選出頂替[加略人猶大的人之前](../Page/加略人猶大.md "wikilink")，被[聖彼得引述](../Page/聖彼得.md "wikilink")。

因第8节的“職分”在英文─“office”─也可以代表官職，美國的[基要派基督徒](../Page/基要派.md "wikilink")，包括政客如Michael
O'Neal\[1\]和[大衛·珀杜](../Page/大衛·珀杜.md "wikilink")\[2\]，常常用這诗篇來詛咒[奧巴馬](../Page/奧巴馬.md "wikilink")。\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]\[6\]\[7\]

## 译文

1.  Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
2.  For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
    opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
3.  They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
    against me without a cause.
4.  For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.
5.  And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
6.  Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right
    hand.

    become sin.
8.  Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
9.  Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

    their bread also out of their desolate places.

    not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
15. Let them be before the Lord continually, that he may cut off the
    memory of them from the earth.
16. Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the
    poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
17. As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in
    blessing, so let it be far from him.
18. As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let
    it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
19. Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a
    girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
20. Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the Lord, and of
    them that speak evil against my soul.
21. But do thou for me, O God the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy
    mercy is good, deliver thou me.
22. For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
23. I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down
    as the locust.
24. My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
25. I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they
    shaked their heads.
26. Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
27. That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, Lord, hast done
    it.
28. Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
    ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
29. Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
    themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
30. I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth; yea, I will praise him
    among the multitude.
31. For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from
    those that condemn his soul.

**資料新聞學（台湾的叫法，在中国大陆称之为数据新闻）**是指透過對大量資料集進行分析與篩檢後來產出新聞報導（故事）的一種新聞處理程序。在資料新聞學中，我們常常會使用到網路上可自由取得的[開放資料](../Page/開放資料.md "wikilink")，然後使用[開放原始碼軟體來處理分析](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/開放原始碼軟體 "wikilink")\[1\]。資料新聞學希望能服務大眾、協助消費者、經理管理人、政治人物來了解固定出現的模式，並根據出現的現像擬定策略。因此，資料新聞學將會使新聞記者在社會上扮演新的角色。

## 定義

[Data_driven_journalism_process.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Data_driven_journalism_process.jpg "fig:Data_driven_journalism_process.jpg")

根據資訊架構師和多媒體新聞記者 Mirko Lorenz 的說法，資訊新聞學是一個包含了下列這些元素的完整 *workflow* (工作流程)
:將資料純淨化、結構化來「深入資料」，挖掘特定資訊來「過濾資料」，再將資料「視覺化」以做出報導。\[2\]另外也可以將這個過處理過程擴充加入其他步驟，使其適用於個人層面或是更廣的公共層面。

資料新聞學訓練員暨作家Paul
Bradshaw用一種類似的方式來描述這種資料導向的新聞工作：必須要能夠使用像是[MySQL或是](../Page/MySQL.md "wikilink")[Python等資料處理軟體來](../Page/Python.md "wikilink")「找到」資料；然後「訊問」它，也就是要能夠理解當中的術語以及統計學；最後藉由開放原始碼工具將其「視覺化」及「混搭」。\[3\]

另外一個以結果導向來定義這個詞的資料記者暨網路趨勢研究者(web strategist)Henk van Ess
(2012)\[4\]認為「資料導向的新聞工作使得記者能夠找到尚未被發現的事件，或是透過這套搜尋資料的流程來找到新的角度完成這份報導，也就是運用可行的開放原始碼工具對這些資料（可能是任何形式）加工並呈現出來。」Van
Ess
認為一些資料導向的工作流程會使其產品「不在好敘事的範疇裡」，因為做出來的結果在於強調問題，而非闡述問題。「一個好的資料導向生產流程擁有不同的層面。它不只能夠讓你找到只對你重要，且個人化的內容，還能夠鑽到相關的細節裡讓你能夠廣覽全局。」

## 基於資料的新聞報導

Telling stories based on the data is the primary goal. The findings from
data can be transformed into any form of [journalistic
writing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/journalistic_writing "wikilink").
Visualizations can be used to create a clear understanding of a complex
situation. Furthermore, elements of storytelling can be used to
illustrate what the findings actually mean, from the perspective of
someone who is affected by a development. This connection between data
and story can be viewed as a "new arc" trying to span the gap between
developments that are relevant, but poorly understood, to a story that
is verifiable, trustworthy, relevant and easy to remember.

## 資料品質

In many investigations the data that can be found might have omissions
or is misleading. As one layer of data-driven journalism a critical
examination of the data quality is important. In other cases the data
might not be public or is not in the right format for further analysis,
e.g. is only available in a
[PDF](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format "wikilink").
Here the process of data-driven journalism can turn into stories about
data quality or refusals to provide the data by institutions. As the
practice as a whole is in early development steps, examinations of data
sources, data sets, data quality and data format are therefore an
equally important part of this work.

### 資料新聞學和信任的力量

Based on the perspective of looking deeper into facts and drivers of
events, there is a suggested change in media strategies: In this view
the idea is to move "from attention to trust". The creation of
attention, which has been a pillar of media business models has lost its
relevance because reports of new events are often faster distributed via
new platforms such as Twitter than through traditional media channels.
On the other hand, trust can be understood as a scarce resource. While
distributing information is much easier and faster via the web, the
abundance of offerings creates costs to verify and check the content of
any story create an opportunity. The view to transform media companies
into trusted data hubs has been described in an article cross-published
in February 2011 on Owni.eu\[5\] and Nieman Lab.\[6\]

## 資料新聞學的進行過程

The process to transform raw data into stories is aking to a refinement
and transformation. The main goal is to extract information recipients
can act upon. The task of a data journalist is to extract what is
hidden. This approach can be applied to almost any context, such as
finances, health, environment or other areas of public interest.

### *倒金字塔資料新聞學*

In 2011, Paul Bradshaw introduced a model, he called ["The Inverted
Pyramid of Data
Journalism"](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/07/07/the-inverted-pyramid-of-data-journalism/).

### 進行步驟

In order to achieve this, the process should be split up into several
steps. While the steps leading to results can differ, a basic
distinction can be made by looking at six phases:

1.  Find: Searching for data on the web
2.  Clean: Process to filter and transform data, preparation for
    visualization
3.  Visualize: Displaying the pattern, either as a static or animated
    visual
4.  Publish: Integrating the visuals, attaching data to stories
5.  Distribute: Enabling access on a variety of devices, such as the
    web, tablets and mobile
6.  Measure: Tracking usage of data stories over time and across the
    spectrum of uses.

### 步驟描述

#### 尋找資料

Data can be obtained directly from governmental databases such as
[data.gov](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/data.gov "wikilink"),
[data.gov.uk](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/data.gov.uk "wikilink") and
World Bank Data API\[7\] but also by placing [Freedom of Information
requests](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_request "wikilink")
to government agencies; some requests are made and aggregated on
websites like the UK's What Do They Know. While there is a worldwide
trend towards opening data, there are national differences as to what
extend that information is freely available in usable formats. If the
data is in a webpage, scrapers are used to generate a spreadsheet.
Examples of scrapers are:
[ScraperWiki](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScraperWiki "wikilink"),
Firefox plugin [OutWit
Hub](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/OutWit_Hub "wikilink") or
[Needlebase](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needlebase "wikilink") (note:
Needlebase will be retired June 1, 2012\[8\]). In other cases
OCR-Software can be used to get data from PDFs.

Data can also be created by the public through crowd sourcing, as shown
in March 2012 at the Datajournalism Conference in Hamburg by Henk van
Ess \[9\]

#### 資料清洗

Usually data is not in a format that is easy to visualize. Examples
being that there are too many data points or that the rows and columns
need to be sorted differently. Another issue is that once investigated
many datasets need to be cleaned, structured and transformed. Various
[open source](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_source "wikilink")
tools like [Google
Refine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Refine "wikilink"), [Data
Wrangler](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Wrangler "wikilink") and
[Google
Spreadsheets](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Spreadsheet "wikilink")\[10\]
allow uploading, extracting or formatting data.

#### 資料視覺化

To visualize data in the form of graphs and charts, applications such as
[Many Eyes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many_Eyes "wikilink") or
[Tableau
Public](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableau_Public "wikilink") are
available. [Yahoo\!
Pipes](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes "wikilink") and Open
Heat Map\[11\] are examples of tools that enable the creation of maps
based on data spreadsheets. The number of options and platforms is
expanding. Some new offerings provide options to search, display and
embed data, an example being
[Timetric](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timetric "wikilink").\[12\]

To create meaningful and relevant visualizations, journalists use a
growing number of tools. There are by now, several descriptions what to
look for and how to do it. Most notable published articles are:

  - Joel Gunter: \#ijf11: [Lessons in data journalism from the New York
    Times, published on
    Journalism.co.uk](http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/editors/2011/04/16/ijf11-lessons-in-data-journalism-from-the-new-york-times/)
    (April 16, 2011)\[13\]
  - Steve Myers: [Using Data Visualization as a Reporting Tool Can
    Reveal Story’s
    Shape](http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/95154/using-data-visualization-as-a-reporting-tool-can-reveal-storys-shape/),
    published on Poynter (April 10, 2009, updated March 4, 2011),
    including a link to a tutorial by Sarah Cohen\[14\]

As of 2011, the use of HTML 5 libraries using the
[canvas](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/canvas "wikilink") tag is gaining
in popularity. There are numerous libraries enabling to graph data in a
growing variety of forms. One example here would be
[RGraph](http://www.rgraph.net/).\[15\] As of 2011 there is a growing
list of [JavaScript
libraries](http://sixrevisions.com/javascript/20-fresh-javascript-data-visualization-libraries/)
allowing to visualize data.

#### 出版資料故事

There are different options to publish data and visualizations. A basic
approach is to attach the data to single stories, similar to embedding
web videos. More advanced concepts allow to create single dossiers, e.g.
to display a number of visualizations, articles and links to the data on
one page. Often such specials have to be coded individually, as many
Content Management Systems are designed to display single posts based on
the date of publication.

#### 散佈資料

Providing access to existing data is another phase, which is gaining
importance. Think of the sites as "marketplaces" (commercial or not),
where datasets can be found easily by others. Especially of the insights
for an article where gained from Open Data, journalists should provide a
link to the data they used for others to investigate (potentially
starting another cycle of interogation, leading to new insights).

Providing access to data and enabling groups to discuss what information
could be extracted is the main idea behind
[Buzzdata](https://web.archive.org/web/20110812235741/http://buzzdata.com/),\[16\]
a site using the concepts of social media such as sharing and following
to create a community for data investigations.

Other platforms (which can be used both to gather or to distribute
data):

  - [Help Me Investigate](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/) (created by
    Paul Bradshaw)\[17\]
  - [Kasabi](http://www.kasabi.com/), (currently in public beta, Aug.
    2011)\[18\]
  - [Timetric](http://timetric.com/)\[19\]

#### 評量以資料說故事的影響

A final step of the process is to measure how often a dataset or
visualization is viewed.

In the context of data-driven journalism, the extent of such tracking,
such as collecting user data or any other information that could be used
for marketing reasons or other uses beyond the control of the user,
should be viewed as problematic. One newer, non-intrusive option to
measure usage is a lightweight tracker called PixelPing. The tracker is
the result of a project by
[ProPublica](../Page/ProPublica.md "wikilink") and
[DocumentCloud](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocumentCloud "wikilink").\[20\]
There is a corresponding back-end solution to collect the data. The
software is open source and can be downloaded via GitHub.\[21\]

## 實例

There is a growing list of examples how data-driven journalism can be
applied:

  - The Guardian, being one of the pioneering media companies in this
    space (see: [Data journalism at the Guardian: what is it and how do
    we do
    it?](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jul/28/data-journalism))\[22\],
    has compiled an extensive list of data stories, see: [All of our
    data journalism in one
    spreadsheet](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jan/27/data-store-office-for-national-statistics)\[23\]

Other prominent uses of data driven journalism is related to the release
by whistle-blower organization
[WikiLeaks](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks "wikilink") of the
[Afghan War
Diary](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Afghan_War_documents_leak "wikilink"),
a compendium of 91,000 secret military reports covering the war in
Afghanistan from 2004 to 2010.\[24\] Three global broadsheets, namely
*[The Guardian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "wikilink")*,
*[The New York
Times](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "wikilink")* and
*[Der Spiegel](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Spiegel "wikilink")*,
dedicated extensive sections\[25\]\[26\]\[27\] to the documents; [The
Guardian](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "wikilink")'s
reporting included an interactive map pointing out the type, location
and casualties caused by 16,000
[IED](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device "wikilink")
attacks,\[28\] [The New York
Times](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "wikilink")
published a selection of reports that permits rolling over underlined
text to reveal explanations of military terms,\[29\] while [Der
Spiegel](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Spiegel "wikilink") provided
hybrid visualizations (containing both graphs and maps) on topics like
the number deaths related to insurgent bomb attacks.\[30\]. For the
[Iraq War logs
release](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_documents_leak "wikilink"),
The Guardian used [Google Fusion
tables](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fusion_tables "wikilink")
to create an interactive map of every incident where someone died\[31\],
a technique it used again in the [England
riots](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_riots "wikilink") of
2011.\[32\]

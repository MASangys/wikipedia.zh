**达特福德跨河道路**是[英国一个由两条隧道和一座桥梁组成的横跨](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英国 "wikilink")[泰晤士河](../Page/泰晤士河.md "wikilink")的公路桥隧组合，是跨[泰晤士河](../Page/泰晤士河.md "wikilink")的主要公路交通通道，承载**英国A282公路**。（英文名：Dartford Crossing或Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing）南端终点位于[英国](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英国 "wikilink")[肯特郡](../Page/肯特郡.md "wikilink")[达特福德](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/达特福德 "wikilink")，北端终点位于[英国](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英國 "wikilink")[埃塞克斯郡](../Page/埃塞克斯郡.md "wikilink")[瑟罗克](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/瑟罗克 "wikilink")。1991年之前称为“达特福德隧道”。

它由两条隧道和斜拉桥女王伊丽莎白二世大桥组成。它是泰晤士河[大伦敦以东段上唯一的固定式公路跨河通道](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/大伦敦 "wikilink")，平均日车流量达13万台次。 该跨河道路分阶段开放：1963年西隧道通车，1980年东隧道通车，1991年女王伊丽莎白二世大桥通车。虽然这个跨河道路未被官方定为[高速公路](../Page/高速公路.md "wikilink")，但它被很多人认为是[英国M25高速公路的一部分](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英国M25高速公路 "wikilink")。北向车流使用隧道，南向车流使用桥梁。有人称之为“英国最重要的公路交通节点之一”，交通拥挤。



该跨河道路的规划始于20世纪30年代末，但由于[第二次世界大战](../Page/第二次世界大战.md "wikilink")而中断，并于20世纪50年代继续进行。其中第一条隧道为单向2车道。后随着交通流量的提升，又修建了修建第二条隧道。1986年建成的[英国M25高速公路分别从隧道两端与隧道相连](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英國M25高速公路 "wikilink")，这大大增加了隧道的交通压力。1988年，该跨河道路启动了有私人融资参与的桥梁规划。桥隧全部完工后，该跨河道路总共拥有双向8车道。

这个跨河道路一直是[收费公路](../Page/收費道路.md "wikilink")。2003年4月1日，改为单向收费。从2008年开始，从晚上10点到早上6点免费。2014年11月，改为不停车收费，官方称为“飞镖收费”（Dart Charge），同时取消了人工收费，仅接受网上支付。达特福德跨河道路附近居民使用该路收费优惠。

## 地理位置

达特福德跨河道路横跨[泰晤士河](../Page/泰晤士河.md "wikilink")，南端终点位于[英国](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英国 "wikilink")[肯特郡](../Page/肯特郡.md "wikilink")[达特福德](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/达特福德 "wikilink")，北端终点位于[英国](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英國 "wikilink")[埃塞克斯郡](../Page/埃塞克斯郡.md "wikilink")[瑟罗克](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/瑟罗克 "wikilink")。靠近[大伦敦东部边界](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/大伦敦 "wikilink")，距伦敦市中心约32千米。\[1\] 其中，两条隧道长1430米\[2\]，斜拉桥高137米，斜拉桥主跨为450米\[3\]。达特福德跨河道路限速80千米/小时\[4\]。连接[伦敦圣潘克拉斯国际车站至](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/圣潘克拉斯车站 "wikilink")[英法海底隧道英国出口的](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英法海底隧道 "wikilink")[1号高速铁路](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/1号高速铁路 "wikilink")，与达特福德跨河道路的连接道路在达特福德跨河道路北端终点以北处不远立体交叉。\[5\]

设计机动车通行能力为每天13.5万台次，但实际上这个跨河道路实际日机动车通行量为16万台次左右。\[6\]英国高速公路管理局称它为：”一个对于英格兰东南部经济而言，至关重要的交通节点”。\[7\]前英国运输大臣帕特里克·麦克洛克林称它为：“国家公路网中一个至关重要的组成部分”。\[8\]瑟罗克市议会称它为：“欧洲交通流量最大、最复杂的公路交通节点之一”。\[9\]按照官方的说法，达特福德跨河道路的两端终点同时为[英国M25高速公路（伦敦外环高速公路）的两端终点](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英国M25高速公路 "wikilink")，达特福德跨河道路本体承载英国A282公路（严格而言，[英国M25高速公路并非完整衔接的环线](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英國M25高速公路 "wikilink")，其跨越泰晤士河的东侧路段——即由桥梁和隧道构成的达特福德跨河道路——划分为一般道路“英国A282公路”）。 通常，南行车辆使用4车道的桥梁，北行车辆使用两条隧道（两条隧道各两车道，共4车道）。桥梁部分可能因大风或维修而关闭，在这种情况下，双向车流均使用隧道。\[10\]\[11\]



### 备用线路

距离达特福德跨河道路最近的机动车跨泰晤士河通道是位于达特福德跨河道路以西的伍利奇渡船（Woolwich Ferry）和黑墙隧道（Blackwall Tunnel），两者都位于伦敦东部。当女王伊丽莎白二世大桥因大风或维修而关闭时，南行车辆中高度超过5米的车辆将无法通过隧道。\[12\]\[13\]

一些新的公路跨河通道被提出，以减轻达特福德跨河道路的交通压力。2004年12月，[伦敦交通局批准了在达特福德跨河道路以西修建泰晤士门户大桥](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/伦敦交通局 "wikilink")（Thames Gateway Bridge）的规划\[14\]，但该计划在2008年11月[庄汉生任伦敦市长期间被取消](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/庄汉生 "wikilink")。\[15\][庄汉生之后提出了在相同位置修建Gallions](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/庄汉生 "wikilink") Reach轮渡作为替代方案。\[16\]下泰晤士隧道（Lower Thames Crossing）是一条拟建在达特福德跨河道路以东的隧道，南端终点在[格雷夫森德](../Page/格雷夫森德.md "wikilink")，北端终点在[提伯利](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/提伯利 "wikilink")。\[17\]\[18\][瑟罗克市有关部门认为这个这条隧道若能建成](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/瑟罗克 "wikilink")，将对控制交通拥堵产生很大的积极作用。\[19\]2016年3月，关于该计划的公众咨询结束。2017年4月公布了隧道路线。\[20\]\[21\]\[22\]但英国公路管理局在2026年之前动工的希望渺茫。\[23\]

2014年11月，一种基于车牌自动识别的不停车收费系统（官方称“Dart Charge”，中文译名：飞镖收费）开始运行。使用网上支付支付过路费可以通过网络或电话提前支付，也可以在过马路后的第二天午夜之前支付，但由于旧的收费站已被拆除，因此无法在现场以现金支付。然而，一些Payzone商店接受现金支付。\[28\]提醒标志上写着“飞镖冲锋;网上找到我们。明天午夜之前付款。“\[29\]\[30\]车辆如果每周七天在早上6点至晚上10点之间使用交叉口，就必须付费，这一点已在高架标志上标示出来。”自2018年10月起，该通道每日收费为:\[31\]\[32\]

A [free-flow](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-flow_tolling "wikilink") electronic charging system called **Dart Charge** began in November 2014 based on [automatic number plate recognition](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/automatic_number_plate_recognition "wikilink"). The charge can be paid online or phone in advance or by midnight the day after crossing, but can no longer be paid in cash at the site since the old toll booths have been removed.\[24\] However, cash payments are accepted at some Payzone shops.\[25\] Reminder signs on approaches to the crossing say "Dart charge; find us online. Pay by midnight tomorrow."\[26\]\[27\] Vehicles have to pay the charge if they use the crossing between 6 am and 10 pm seven days per week, and this is indicated on overhead-gantry signs. Daily charges for the crossing since October 2018 are:\[28\]\[29\]

| 车辆类型             | 不使用预付款账户的过路费 | 使用预付款账户的过路费 |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----------- |

收费时间段过路费（2018年10月数据）

Various categories of vehicles are exempt from the charge, including emergency services vehicles, military vehicles and those exempt from [Vehicle Excise Duty](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Excise_Duty "wikilink") on the grounds of disability.\[31\]

The charges vary according to the type of vehicle. Motorcycles are free but there are standard charges for cars, two-axle goods vehicles and larger vehicles with more than two axles.\[32\] Drivers who fail to pay the charge are issued with a penalty charge notice.\[33\] There are no signs warning of penalty charges.

Since 2008, a local residents' scheme gives 50 crossings to car drivers resident in the Dartford and Thurrock council areas for an annual registration fee of £10, with additional crossings at 20p each.\[34\] On 1 March 2014,\[35\] this scheme was extended to include privately owned two-axle goods vehicles. A further option was introduced giving unlimited crossings for £20 annually.\[36\] Around 44,000 drivers take advantage of this scheme each year.\[37\] Although the website for paying the charge is operated by the UK Government, the day to day operations are run by French public roads operator [Société des Autoroutes du Nord et de l'Est de la France](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Société_des_Autoroutes_du_Nord_et_de_l'Est_de_la_France "wikilink") (SANEF).\[38\]

## 历史

### 西隧道

[左](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dartford_crossing_approach.jpg "fig:左") The idea of a tunnel crossing was first proposed by the [Ministry of Transport](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Transport "wikilink") in 1924.\[39\] Initial reports at the start of the year suggested a crossing between [Tilbury](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilbury "wikilink") and [Gravesend](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravesend,_Kent "wikilink"), replacing a [ferry service](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravesend–Tilbury_Ferry "wikilink"),\[40\] but this had been rejected by July in favour of a route further upstream, near Dartford.\[41\] By 1929, the total cost of building the tunnel had been estimated at £3 million (equivalent to £ million in ).\[42\] The tunnel was planned to be part of a general orbital route around London and was provisionally known as part of the "South Orbital Road".

The first engineering work to take place was a [compressed air](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/compressed_air "wikilink") driven pilot tunnel, which was drilled between 1936 and 1938. Work on the tunnel was delayed due to World War II, and resumed in 1959, using a [Greathead Shield](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnelling_shield "wikilink"), similar to the work on the [Blackwall Tunnel](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwall_Tunnel "wikilink") some 60 years earlier. The delay in work due to the war allowed the tunnel's design to be improved, which included a better ventilation system. After negotiations with the Ministry of Transport, Kent and Essex County Councils obtained government approval to charge tolls in 1960, before opening. The two-lane bore tunnel opened to traffic on 18 November 1963;\[43\] the total project cost was £13 million (equivalent to £ million in )\[44\] and it initially served approximately 12,000 vehicles per day.

The toll was originally two [shillings](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling_\(British_coin\) "wikilink") and [sixpence](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixpence_\(British_coin\) "wikilink"), equivalent to 12.5p post-[decimalisation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/decimalisation "wikilink"), and approximately equivalent in purchasing power to £ in .\[45\] The Dartford Tunnel Act 1967 gave Kent and Essex County Councils authority to change the tolls, and in December 1977, the toll was raised from 25p to 35p for cars, 40p to 55p for 2 axle goods vehicles, and 60p to 85p for HGVs.\[46\] By 1984, the toll for cars had risen to 60p.\[47\]

### 东隧道

[缩略图](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dartford_Tunnel_Ventilation_Shaft_-_geograph.org.uk_-_4416.jpg "fig:缩略图") The first tunnel was expected to carry two million vehicles a year\[48\] but by 1970 was carrying over eight million.\[49\] That year, [Michael Heseltine](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Heseltine "wikilink"), then a junior transport minister, announced that a second tunnel would be built in conjunction with the North Orbital Road, later to become the M25.\[50\]

Construction was approved in April 1971, with an initial expected opening date in 1976.\[51\] Work was delayed due to a lack of funds, which was resolved by [EEC](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEC "wikilink") funding granted in 1974.\[52\] The second tunnel opened in May 1980, allowing each tunnel to handle one direction of traffic, by which time the joint capacity of the two tunnels had increased to 65,000 vehicles per day. Connection of the crossing to the M25 was completed on the northerly Essex side in September 1982 (Junction 31), and to the southerly Kent side in September 1986 (Junction 1a).\[53\] Following the completion of the M25 in 1986, the daily demand had grown to 79,000 vehicles.

During the early 1980s, it was anticipated that traffic through the tunnel would rise on the completion of the M25 in 1986. At the time, the expectation was that other routes in London would be improved instead, diverting 15% of traffic away from the tunnel.\[54\] In 1985, the Transport Minister, [Lynda Chalker](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynda_Chalker "wikilink"), announced that the number of toll booths would be increased to 12 each way, but concern grew that two tunnels would not be able to cope with the full demands of a completed M25.\[55\]

Between September 1985 and December 1986, proposals for improvements to the Dartford Crossing underwent several changes, and in 1986, a [Trafalgar House](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_House_\(company\) "wikilink") consortium won a bid to build a new bridge at Dartford crossing, valued at £86 million (£ million in ). At the time there were several other privately financed projects planned or under construction in the UK, including the [Second Severn Crossing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Severn_Crossing "wikilink"). From 1981 until the establishment of the [Private Finance Initiatives](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Finance_Initiative "wikilink") (PFIs) in the late 1980s, private investment projects were governed by the [Ryrie Rules](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryrie_Rules "wikilink") which dictated that "any privately-financed solution must be shown to be more cost-effective than a publicly-financed alternative, and that privately-financed expenditure by nationalised industries could not be additional to public expenditure provision" \[annual budget\], "which would be reduced by the amount of private finance borrowed."

On 31 July 1988, a Private Finance Initiative concession was enabled under the Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Act 1988, which transferred control of the crossing from Kent and Essex county councils to Dartford River Crossing Limited, a private company managed by Rodney Jones. The company would also bear the debt of the bridge, then under construction, "financed 100% by debt, with no equity contribution". The private company was at risk of not recuperating their costs, but ultimately the Dartford scheme demonstrated that the Ryrie Rules were no longer a barrier to the private financing of public infrastructure projects. The concession was scheduled for 20 years from the transfer date, with a stipulation that it could end when debts had been paid off, which was agreed to have been achieved on 31 March 2002. According to the *International Handbook on Public-Private Partnership*, the chief financing for the project came from a "20-year subordinated loan stock, 16-year loan stock and £85 million (£ million in ) as a term loan from banks".

Construction of the bridge started immediately after the creation of the PFI in 1988.\[56\] It was designed by German civil engineer , and the two main [caissons](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caisson_\(engineering\) "wikilink") supporting the bridge piers were constructed in the Netherlands. Each caisson was designed to withstand a bridge strike of a ship weighing up to 65,000 tonnes and travelling up to \[57\] The bridge deck is about  high, and it took a team of around 56 to assemble its structure. During construction of the approach road, a World War II bomb was found in its path, which required closure of the entire crossing.\[58\]

The bridge was opened by [Queen Elizabeth II](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II "wikilink") on 30 October 1991. The total cost of construction was £120 million (£ in ), including £30 million (£ million in ) for the approach roads.\[59\] The proposed name had been simply the Dartford Bridge, but Thurrock residents objected and suggested the Tilbury Bridge, leading to a compromise.\[60\] At the time of opening, it had the longest cable-stayed span of any bridge in Europe.\[61\] It is the only bridge across the Thames downstream of Central London to be opened since [Tower Bridge](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge "wikilink") in 1894.\[62\]

### Charging scheme

In 2000, the [European Union](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "wikilink") issued a directive that [value-added tax](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/value-added_tax "wikilink") should be charged on all road tolls, including the Dartford Crossing. The Government opposed the directive and said it would bear the additional cost.\[63\] It was anticipated that the tolls would be removed on 1 April 2003 under the original PFI scheme contract. However, the Highways Agency decided that the tolls would become a "charge", under legislation introduced by the [Transport Act 2000](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Act_2000 "wikilink") to introduce charging schemes on any trunk road bridge or tunnel at least  in length.\[64\]

Under the 2000 Transport Act, the A282 Trunk Road (Dartford-Thurrock Crossing charging scheme) Order 2002 allowed the continuation of the crossing fee, which officially became a charge and not a toll on 1 April 2003. Management of the crossing was contracted to Le Crossing Company Limited on behalf of the Highways Agency. In September 2009 the Highways Agency made a new contract with Connect Plus (M25) Limited. As well as maintaining the crossing, the contract required the company to widen around 40 miles of the M25 and to refurbish a tunnel on the [A1(M)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1\(M\) "wikilink") at [Hatfield](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield,_Hertfordshire "wikilink"). In October 2009, the Government announced its intention to sell the crossing as part of a public sector deficit reduction strategy.\[65\] The announcement was unpopular with local residents, who encouraged drivers to sound their horns in protest when using the crossing.\[66\] After the change of government following the [2010 general election](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election "wikilink"), the new [prime minister](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") [David Cameron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron "wikilink") announced that the crossing might still be sold, despite local opposition, particularly from [Gareth Johnson](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Johnson "wikilink"), [member of parliament](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament#United_Kingdom "wikilink") for Dartford.\[67\] Subsequently, the chancellor [George Osborne](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne "wikilink") announced that charges would be increased instead to cover the budget deficit.\[68\] Pre-pay accounts for the crossing were introduced around this time; drivers held an [electronic device](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_toll_collection "wikilink") called a DART-Tag in the vehicle that automatically deducted the charge at payment booths.\[69\] This was abolished when the Dart Charge was introduced in 2014.\[70\]

Under the 2008 Charging Order introduced on 15 November 2008, charges between 10 pm and 6 am were discontinued, but standard daytime rates increased, starting at £1.50 for cars.\[71\] On 7 October 2012 the charges increased to £2 for cars, £2.50 for 2 axle goods vehicles and £5 for multi-axle goods vehicles.\[72\] By 2012, local businesses were complaining that the crossing's charge booths were impeding local growth. The government announced that a new electronic charging system would be introduced in 2014. Drivers would be able to pay by phone, text, online or in shops.\[73\] The charge was proposed to increase to £2.50 for cars, £3 for two-axle goods vehicles and £6 for multi-axle vehicles.\[74\] Drivers not exempt and not paying the charge within 28 days are charged £105.\[75\]

Preparation work on the free-flow scheme started in April 2014.\[76\] Concerns were raised about reliability, with a Highways Agency report predicting that it could lose up to £6m of unpaid charges per year.\[77\] In September, the Highways Agency announced that the new scheme would start to operate at the end of November, though related works to remove barriers would continue until April 2015.\[78\] Subsequently, the date for removal of the booths was confirmed as 30 November.\[79\]

The Dart Charge scheme was considered a success by the project management, who claimed it has reduced peak-time round trips over the crossing by 15 minutes. [The Automobile Association](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Automobile_Association "wikilink") said the scheme had faults, while a BBC report showed 1.8 million fines had been issued for failure to pay in the year since the charge was set up.\[80\]

## 交通

A total of 1,486,929,267 vehicles have used the crossing as of 31 March 2014. The highest recorded daily usage was 181,990 vehicles on 23 July 2004; since then traffic levels have decreased. From April 2013 to March 2014, 49,645,356 vehicles used the crossing: a daily average of 136,015 vehicles.\[81\] The total income for the financial year ended 31 March 2012 was £72,147,091, while the corresponding figure for the following financial year was £80,331,662. A 2016 report by Highways England suggested the crossing is used around 50 million times a year.\[82\]

Bicycles are not permitted on the crossing, but cyclists can be carried across the crossing by the transport authority at no charge. Cyclists report to the crossing control offices on either side, using a free telephone service. The transfer takes around 15 to 30 minutes.\[83\]

[缩略图](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dartford_Tunnel_bus.jpg "fig:缩略图") In October 1963, [London Transport](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Transport_Executive "wikilink") ordered five [double decker](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-decker_bus "wikilink") buses based on the Ford [Thames Trader](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Trader "wikilink") chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck purpose-built for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above the level of the road, accessible from special platforms built at either end of the tunnel; there was also a ladder built into the side of the bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service.\[84\] One of these buses has been preserved.\[85\]

The transport of hazardous goods through the crossing is governed by the European [ADR Agreement](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Agreement_concerning_the_International_Carriage_of_Dangerous_Goods_by_Road "wikilink"). The Dartford Crossing is class C, which restricts transporting goods such as nitrates and flammable liquids.\[86\]\[87\] The introduction of the ADR scheme initially caused confusion, and for a short time, transporting aerosols through the tunnel was banned.\[88\] Certain hazardous goods vehicles, together with some oversize and abnormal loads (if permitted) may require escorting by [Highways Agency Traffic Officers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highways_Agency_Traffic_Officers "wikilink"). The crossing authority must hold exercises in conjunction with the [emergency services](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/emergency_service "wikilink"). In 2006 Exercise Orpheus was held, involving the closure of both road tunnels for five hours.\[89\]

The tunnel is patrolled by Highways Agency Traffic Officers. Officers may stop and direct traffic on the crossing and its approach roads, and must be in uniform to exercise their powers.\[90\] The crossing's speed limit is enforced by [speed cameras](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/speed_camera "wikilink"); between October 2012 and June 2014, 24,229 drivers were caught speeding, with some travelling as fast as  A spokesman from the Highways Agency said the cameras were "helping us improve safety and make journeys more reliable".\[91\] The bridge also has a reduced speed limit of  when [crosswind](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/crosswind "wikilink") is faster than  or headwind faster than , and is closed entirely if Britain's national weather service, the [Met Office](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office "wikilink"), predicts crosswind above  or headwind above .\[92\]

### Congestion

The crossing is the busiest in the United Kingdom.\[93\]\[94\] Because the design capacity has been exceeded, the crossing is subject to major traffic congestion and disruption, particularly when parts are closed because of accidents or bad weather. Though the Government was adamant that the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge should be designed to avoid closure due to high winds,\[95\] the bridge has nevertheless had to close on occasions. On 12 February 2014, during the [winter storms](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_storms_of_2013–14_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"), it was closed owing to  winds,\[96\] and again on the evening of 13–14 February 2014.\[97\]

At busy times there was significant delay at the payment booths when these existed. Because there are numerous junctions on either side of the crossing, a high proportion of local traffic mixes with long distance traffic, for example travelling from the North and Midlands onwards to Continental Europe. In 2004, a BBC survey reported that the crossing was "the most stressful section of the M25"\[98\] while in 2009, the crossing was listed in a [Royal Automobile Club](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Automobile_Club "wikilink") report as the fourth most congested road in Britain.\[99\] Though Highways England have reported greatly improved journey times since automatic charging was introduced, [Gareth Johnson](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Johnson "wikilink") MP claims otherwise and has insisted that the Lower Thames Crossing, along with improved signing around Dartford, are better options to reduce congestion.\[100\] In 2015, he said the crossing was Britain's worst stretch of motorway.\[101\] There are agreed plans to create another crossing of the Thames in the East of London to ease congestion at the Dartford Crossing.

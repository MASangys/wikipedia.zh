## 历史

[Hood,_13th_century.png](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hood,_13th_century.png "fig:Hood,_13th_century.png")
几个世纪以来，连帽衫一直被认为是男装和女装的一部分。“连帽衫”这个名字来自于盎格鲁-撒克逊语的*hōd*一词\[1\]
（和英语中的"hat"（帽子）同源\[2\]
）。这种服装的风格和形式的历史可以追溯到中世纪的欧洲。当时的僧侣平常的服装包括一种附在外衣或长袍上的一种叫hood的大兜帽\[3\]，除此之外，连帽披风和一种叫的帽子也是在当时的户外工作者中非常普遍的装扮。连帽衫最早至少在十二世纪的英国出现，这可能是在[诺曼征服英格兰时进口的](../Page/诺曼征服英格兰.md "wikilink")。\[4\]

连帽衫在20世纪30年代在美国第一次开始批量生产。现代的连帽衫最早在20世纪30年代由生产，当时连帽衫主要销售给在纽约北部严寒地区工作的工人。\[5\]“连帽衫”这个词在20世纪90年代于大众中流行。\[6\]
Hooded garments have been a documented part of men's and women's wear
for centuries. The word
*[hood](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:hood "wikilink")* derives
from the Anglo-Saxon word *hōd*,\[7\] ultimately of the same root as
English *[hat](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/hat "wikilink")*.\[8\] The
garment's style and form can be traced back to [Medieval
Europe](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Europe "wikilink") when
the normal clothing for
[monks](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_monasticism "wikilink")
included a hood called a
[cowl](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/cowl "wikilink") attached to a
[tunic](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/tunic "wikilink") or robes,\[9\]
and a
[chaperon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/chaperon_\(headgear\) "wikilink")
or hooded cape was very commonly worn by any outdoors worker. Its
appearance was known in England at least as early as the 12th century,
possibly an import with the [Norman conquest of
England](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England "wikilink"),
as the *capa* was "a short hooded cloak which was common in
Normandy".\[10\] The hooded sweatshirt was first produced in the [United
States](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "wikilink") starting
in the 1930s. The modern clothing style was first produced by
[Champion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion_\(sportswear\) "wikilink")
in the 1930s and marketed to laborers working in freezing temperatures
in [upstate New
York](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/upstate_New_York "wikilink").\[11\]
The term *hoodie* entered popular usage in the 1990s.\[12\]

The hoodie took off in the
[1970s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_in_fashion "wikilink"), with
several factors contributing to its success. [Hip hop
culture](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_culture "wikilink")
developed in [New York
City](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "wikilink") around
this time, and high fashion also contributed during this era, as Norma
Kamali and other high-profile designers embraced and glamorized the new
clothing.\[13\] Most critical to the hoodie's popularity during this
time was its iconic appearance in the blockbuster
*[Rocky](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky "wikilink")* film. At the
same time hoodies started emerging in the Geek culture when Mark
LoGiurato, introduced them at companies such as the Software Bottling
Company.\[14\] The rise of hoodies with university logos began around
this time.

By the
[1990s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s_in_fashion "wikilink"), the
hoodie had evolved into a symbol of isolation, a statement of academic
spirit, and several fashion collections.\[15\] The association with
[chavs](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/chav "wikilink") or
[neds](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/neds "wikilink") in the UK
developed around this time, as their popularity rose with that specific
demographic. Young men, often
[skateboarders](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding "wikilink")
or [surfers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing "wikilink"), sported
the hoodie and spread the trend across the western United States, most
significantly in
[California](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "wikilink").
[Tommy
Hilfiger](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Hilfiger "wikilink"),
[Giorgio
Armani](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Armani "wikilink"), and
[Ralph Lauren](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren "wikilink"),
for example, used the hoodie as the primary component for many of their
collections in the 1990s.\[16\]\[17\] A crystal-studded hoodie made by
rapper [Sean "Diddy"
Combs](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs "wikilink") was acquired
by the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.\[18\]

### 澳大利亚

In June 2011, police in
[Wynnum](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynnum,_Queensland "wikilink"),
[Brisbane](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane "wikilink"), launched
a "Hoodie Free Zone" initiative, with shopkeepers encouraged to ask
hoodie-wearers to leave. The zone is part of an initiative to educate
businesses on how they can avoid armed robberies, in which the clothing
is often worn.\[19\]

### 加拿大

Across Canada, hoodies are a popular clothing item in which are
sometimes worn under a coat or jacket to provide an extra layer of
clothing during the winter. In the province of
[Saskatchewan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan "wikilink"),
hoodies without zippers are "bunny hugs."\[20\]

### 新西兰

The "Hoodies on Parliament—politicians challenge youth stereotypes"
campaign was launched in May 2008 in [New
Zealand](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "wikilink") (NZ) as
part of the annual national Youth Week event, a pro-youth initiative
organized to challenge youth stereotypes. To launch the campaign, NZ
politicians, including National MP Nicky Wagner, Green Party MPs Sue
Bradford, Nandor Tanczos and Metiria Turei, and Maori party MP Hone
Harawira, wore hoodies while standing on the steps of the country's
parliament. Archbishop David Moxon, Archbishop of the Anglican Dioceses,
and Brian Turner President of the Methodist Church of NZ also
participated in the campaign.\[21\]

Support and criticism were raised by politicians, who were divided over
the 2008 event.\[22\]\[23\] One strong response was drawn from a local
government council member, Dale Evans, who donned a [Ku Klux
Klan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan "wikilink") outfit in
protest, citing the hoodie as "not an appropriate article of clothing to
celebrate."\[24\]

"Goodie in a Hoodie" day was then run in 2009 by New Zealand Adolescent
Health and Development (NZAAHD) in partnership with Age Concern—the
organisations used the campaign to highlight the stereotypes that both
young people and the elderly face in New Zealand. Liz Baxendine,
president of Age Concern at the time, said to the media:

> Older people and young people have a lot in common. We both face
> stereotypes based on our age rather than our real achievements and
> outlook on life ... we've got to destigmatise the hoodie and see it
> for what it is. Everyone wears them. We need to take the hoodie
> back\!\[25\]

### 英国

In the [UK](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "wikilink"),
hoodies have been the subject of much criticism; some shoplifters have
used the hood to conceal their identities from
[CCTV](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television "wikilink")
cameras in shopping centres.\[26\] The hoodie became a popular clothing
item by the 1990s. During the 21st century, it had gained a negative
image, being associated with trouble making teens and [anti-social
behaviour](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behavior "wikilink").
It became one of the later items associated with
"[chavs](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/chav "wikilink")", or
[Neds](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neds "wikilink").

Angela McRobbie, professor of communications at [Goldsmiths
College](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldsmiths_College "wikilink") in
the UK, says the appeal of the hoodie is because of its promise of
anonymity, mystery and anxiety. "The point of origin is obviously black
American [hip-hop](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/hip-hop "wikilink")
culture, now thoroughly mainstream and a key part of the global economy.
Leisure and sportswear adopted for everyday wear suggests a distance
from the world of office
[suit](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/suit_\(clothing\) "wikilink") or
[school
uniform](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_uniform "wikilink"). Rap
culture celebrates defiance, as it narrates the experience of [social
exclusion](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_exclusion "wikilink").
Musically and stylistically, it projects menace and danger as well as
anger and rage. The hooded top is one in a long line of garments chosen
by young people, usually boys, to which are ascribed meanings suggesting
that they are 'up to no good'. In the past, such appropriation was
usually restricted to membership of specific youth cultures—leather
jackets, [bondage
trousers](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/bondage_trousers "wikilink")—but
nowadays it is the norm among young people to flag up their music and
cultural preferences in this way, hence the adoption of the hoodie by
boys across the boundaries of age, ethnicity and class."\[27\]

In May 2005,
[Bluewater](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluewater_\(shopping_centre\) "wikilink")
shopping centre in [Kent](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent "wikilink")
caused outrage by launching a code of conduct which bans its shoppers
from sporting hoodies or [baseball
caps](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/baseball_cap "wikilink"), although
the garments remain on sale. [John
Prescott](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prescott "wikilink")
welcomed the move, stating that he had felt threatened by the presence
of hooded teenagers at a motorway service station.\[28\] Then-[Prime
Minister](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink")
[Tony Blair](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair "wikilink") openly
supported this stance and vowed to clamp down on the [anti-social
behaviour](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-social_behavior "wikilink")
with which hoodie wearers are sometimes associated. London-based rapper
[Lady
Sovereign](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Sovereign "wikilink")
published a single titled
"[Hoodie](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodie_\(Lady_Sovereign_song\) "wikilink")"
in protest as part of a "Save the Hoodie" campaign.\[29\]

In 2005, [Coombeshead
College](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coombeshead_College "wikilink")
in the south-west of England allowed the hoodie to become part of the
boys' [school
uniform](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_uniform "wikilink"), but
the hood could be put up only when it rained. The principal, Richard
Haigh, stated that the move would help to calm some of what he called
the "hysteria" surrounding the garment.\[30\]

The [JCB Academy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/JCB_Academy "wikilink")
allows hoodies, but only a [navy
blue](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/navy_blue "wikilink") type sold in
the school shop.

In February 2006, a 58-year-old teacher who was wearing a hooded top was
asked to remove it when entering a
[Tesco](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco "wikilink") store in
[Swindon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swindon "wikilink"). According
to the teacher, she was wearing the hood because "my hair's a mess". The
store did not have a hoodie policy. The shop apologized and said it was
taking action to "make sure this doesn't happen again."\[31\]

In July 2006, [David
Cameron](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron "wikilink"), leader
of the [Conservative
Party](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_\(UK\) "wikilink"),
made a speech suggesting that the hoodie was worn more for defensive
than offensive purposes.\[32\] The speech was referred to as "hug a
hoodie" by the [Labour
Party](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_\(UK\) "wikilink").\[33\]\[34\]

Despite the controversy, the hoodie has been embraced by people from all
backgrounds. [Zara
Phillips](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zara_Phillips "wikilink"), a
member of the British royal family, has included hoodies in her range of
equestrian clothing at
[Musto](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musto_\(company\) "wikilink").\[35\]

### 美国

Throughout the U.S., it is common for middle school, high school, and
college students to wear sweatshirts—with or without hoods—that display
their respective school names or mascots across the chest, either as
part of a uniform or personal preference. Hoodies have become mainstream
fashion in the U.S., transcending the clothing item's original
utilitarian purpose,\[36\] similar to
[jeans](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/jeans "wikilink"). This has found
its way into a variety of styles, even so far as to be worn under a suit
jacket.

The hooded sweatshirt is a utilitarian garment that originated in the
1930s for workers in cold [New
York](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_\(state\) "wikilink")
warehouses.\[37\] Hoodies were later adopted by [hip
hop](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/hip_hop "wikilink") culture as a
symbol of what one reporter termed "cool anonymity and vague
menace."\[38\] When the garment was depicted in FBI composite drawings
of Unabomber [Ted
Kaczynski](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski "wikilink"), the
hoodie became linked to "seedy threatening criminality," thereby further
asserting its non-mainstream symbolism.\[39\]

In 2012 [Trayvon
Martin](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin "wikilink")
was shot in a hoodie, and protests over his death involved
hoodies.\[40\]\[41\] [Fox
News](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel "wikilink") host
[Geraldo
Rivera](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldo_Rivera "wikilink")
encouraged young black people to stop wearing hoodies\[42\] though he
later apologized for his comments.\[43\]

[Facebook](../Page/Facebook.md "wikilink") CEO [Mark
Zuckerberg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg "wikilink")
often wears a plain grey hoodie rather than a business suit, drawing
comment during his company's 2012 [initial public
offering](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/initial_public_offering "wikilink").\[44\]

In 2015, Oklahoma state representative [Don
Barrington](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Barrington "wikilink")
proposed a bill to criminalize wearing a "robe, mask or other disguise"
in public that would "intentionally conceal the wearer's identity",
which was criticized as an attempt to criminalize the wearing of the
hoodie.\[45\]

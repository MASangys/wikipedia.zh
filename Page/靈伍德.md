1.  "Before attempting to explain this name, a note must be made on
    B.1066, a charter which Birch identifies with Ringwood. The [VCH.
    Hants](http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56894),
    points out that this charter professes to record a grant of the
    lands concerned to Abingdon Abbey, but that there is no other record
    of the abbey holding lands at Ringwood. It also mentions that in the
    Rolls Series Rimecuda is identified with Ruscombe, Berks. With
    regard to the last identification it may be said without further ado
    that the survey renders it quite impossible. Whether the grant be
    genuine or not, the survey attached to it is almost certainly that
    of the bounds of the lands of Ringwood as they were in early times.
    The survey mentions the Avon, Linford and Fulford, and, possibly,
    Sandford, all of them names connected with Ringwood. The agreement
    is too marked for it to be taken as a mere coincidence. Birch's
    identification is almost certainly correct." — *The Archaeological
    Journal*, (1930), Volume 84, page 192

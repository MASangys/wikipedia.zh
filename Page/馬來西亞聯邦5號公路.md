## 背景

5号公路是马来西亚半岛的三条主要南北向联邦公路，另两个为[1号和](../Page/马来西亚联邦1号公路.md "wikilink")[3号公路](../Page/马来西亚联邦3号公路.md "wikilink")\[3\]。5号公路是3条主要道路中最短的，处于半岛西海岸沿海一带\[4\]。5号公路的0公里起点位于[柔佛州的](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/柔佛州 "wikilink")[士姑来](../Page/士姑来.md "wikilink")，并设有道路枢纽与位于半岛中间的主干道路1号公路衔接。联邦公路从士姑来－笨珍高速公路（东西向）开始至小笨珍，并在笨珍之后沿海岸线往北至[实兆远](../Page/实兆远.md "wikilink")\[5\]。在巴株峇辖,
the FT5 highway forms a part of the [Batu Bahat–Kluang
Road](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Federal_Route_50 "wikilink")
from Banang Roundabout to Mount Soga Intersection, but was signed as
FT5; the Batu Pahat–Kluang Road assumes the FT50 designation from Mount
Soga Intersection onwards. At Mount Soga Intersection, the FT5 highway
is diverted to Jalan Peserai FT5 that forms the Muar–Batu Pahat Road FT5
to [巴冬](../Page/巴冬.md "wikilink").\[6\] At
[巴冬](../Page/巴冬.md "wikilink"), the FT5 route is diverted to
Jalan Abdul Rahman FT5 to [麻坡](../Page/麻坡.md "wikilink"), where it
passes three [环形交叉s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/环形交叉 "wikilink")
(Khalidi Roundabout, Sulaiman Roundabout and Bentayan Roundabout) before
the FT5 route is diverted once again to Jalan Bakri FT5 at Bentayan
Roundabout, which later continues as the [Sultan Ismail
Bridge](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Ismail_Bridge "wikilink")
FT5 and Jalan Kesang FT5.\[7\]

At Parit Bunga Interchange, the FT5 route is once again diverted to the
left to become [Lebuh
AMJ](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebuh_AMJ "wikilink") FT5. At Kesang
Interchange, the FT5 route is diverted to the two-lane Melaka–Muar Road
FT5, while the Lebuh AMJ itself changes its route number to FT19.
Muar–Melaka Road FT5 ends at Duyong Intersection where it overlaps
with the Lebuh AMJ FT19 to Semabok Interchange, where the FT5 route is
diverted to Jalan Semabok FT5.\[8\] At
[马六甲市](../Page/马六甲市.md "wikilink"), the Federal Route 5
passes through a maze of old streets before it becomes Jalan Tengkera
FT5 where it forms a part of the Melaka–Port Dickson Road FT5.\[9\] The
Melaka–Port Dickson Road FT5 ends at
[Lukut](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukut "wikilink"), where the FT5
route is rerouted to Jalan Sepang FT5, while the road itself continues
as the [Seremban–Port Dickson
Road](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Federal_Route_53 "wikilink")
FT53.\[10\]

At [雪邦县](../Page/雪邦县.md "wikilink"), the Federal Route 5 is rerouted to
Jalan Morib FT5. At Morib, the route is diverted twice to Jalan Kelanang
FT5 and then Jalan Sultan Alam Shah FT5 to
[万津](../Page/万津.md "wikilink"). At Banting, the FT5 road is
rerouted to [Jalan Langat
FT5](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klang–Banting_Highway "wikilink")
to Klang.\[11\] At [巴生市](../Page/巴生市.md "wikilink"), it overlaps with
the [Federal Route
2](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Federal_Route_2 "wikilink") at
[Jalan Jambatan
Kota](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalan_Jambatan_Kota "wikilink")
FT2/FT5 from Simpang Lima Roundabout Interchange to Simpang Tujuh
Roundabout Interchange, where the Federal Route 5 is diverted to Jalan
Kapar FT5 which forms a part of the Klang–Teluk Intan Road FT5, while
Jalan Jambatan Kota itself continues as the
[联邦大道](../Page/联邦大道.md "wikilink").\[12\]

At Mile 5, Klang–Teluk Intan Road FT5 near Batak Rabit, the Federal
Route 5 is diverted to [Sultan Yusuf
Bridge](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Yusuf_Bridge "wikilink")
FT5 to Sitiawan, while the Klang–Teluk Intan Road changes its route
number to FT58. Starting from [实兆远](../Page/实兆远.md "wikilink"),
[霹靂州](../Page/霹靂州.md "wikilink") to its northern terminus at
[怡保](../Page/怡保.md "wikilink"), the Federal Route 5 ceases to be the
main coastal trunk road; its role is taken by [Federal Route
60](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Federal_Route_60 "wikilink")
and [Federal Route
1](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Federal_Route_1 "wikilink").
From Sitiawan, the Federal Route 5 is rerouted for the last time to
[Ipoh–Lumut
Highway](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipoh–Lumut_Highway "wikilink")
FT5 to its northern terminus at Jelapang near Ipoh, where the road is
linked to the [North–South
Expressway](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/North–South_Expressway_Northern_Route "wikilink")
E1 and [Jalan Kuala Kangsar
FT1](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Federal_Route_1 "wikilink")
via Jalan Jelapang A1.\[13\]

## 历史

The Federal Route 5 started as a short road from
[马六甲市](../Page/马六甲市.md "wikilink") to
[Merlimau](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlimau "wikilink"),
constructed in 1887.\[14\] About a decade later, another road from Ipoh
to Lumut was constructed, featuring the Bota Bridge that crossed the
[Perak
River](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perak_River "wikilink").\[15\]\[16\]
In 1911, the state government of [柔佛](../Page/柔佛.md "wikilink")
collaborated with the [英国](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/英国 "wikilink")
colonial government to develop a road network from
[新山](../Page/新山.md "wikilink") to
[峇株巴辖县](../Page/峇株巴辖县.md "wikilink") and Muar.\[17\]
As a result, the [Batu Pahat–Kluang–Mersing
Road](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Federal_Route_50 "wikilink")
was completed in 1919,\[18\] where the section of the Banang Roundabout
to Mount Soga Intersection formed a part of the present-day Federal
Route 5.\[19\]

The next completed section was the Muar–Batu Pahat Road FT5, completed
in 1929. At the same time, the Melaka–Merlimau Road FT5 was extended to
Muar as well. Also completed at the same time was the Melaka–Port
Dickson Road FT5, which was built as an extension of the [Seremban–Port
Dickson
Road](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Federal_Route_53 "wikilink")
which was completed earlier in 1910.\[20\] In 1939, the coastal road
sections in Selangor from Klang to Sepang and from Klang and [安顺
(霹雳)](../Page/安顺_\(霹雳\).md "wikilink") was opened to motorists. The
Skudai–Pontian Road FT5 and Batu Pahat–Pontian Road FT5 were also
completed in the same year.\[21\]\[22\]

In 1967, the old Bota Bridge FT5 was collapsed due to a huge
[洪水](../Page/洪水.md "wikilink"), effectively cutting off the
transportation link between Ipoh and Lumut. As a result, a new
replacement bridge known as the [Sultan Idris Shah II
Bridge](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Idris_Shah_II_Bridge "wikilink")
FT5 was constructed with the total cost of RM3.1 million.\[23\] The new
Sultan Idris Shah II Bridge FT5 was completed in 1973 and was opened to
motorists on February 1973.\[24\]

Also in 1967, two bridges at Muar and Batu Pahat were opened to
motorists as toll bridges. Funded by a RM9 million loan from
[大通銀行](../Page/大通銀行.md "wikilink"), the federal government began
the construction of both bridges in 1965 and was completed in early
1967. The bridge in Muar was named as [Sultan Ismail
Bridge](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Ismail_Bridge "wikilink").\[25\]
Two toll plazas were erected at Tanjung Agas and Peserai
respectively.\[26\] However, due to numerous protests by motorists, the
toll rate was reduced in 1971, before the toll collection was fully
abolished in 1975.\[27\]

In 1970, the Kuala Selangor Bridge FT5 was proposed.\[28\] However, the
project sparked a controversy due to delays caused by the failure of the
original contractor to complete the job.\[29\] As a result, a new tender
was opened in 1976 to get a new contractor to complete the abandoned
Kuala Selangor Bridge construction job. Meanwhile, the construction of
the Sabak Bernam Bridge FT5 was started in 1977.\[30\] The Kuala
Selangor Bridge FT5, together with the Sabak Bernam Bridge FT5, were
completed in 1980. The bridge in Kuala Selangor was named as [Sultan
Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah
Bridge](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Salahuddin_Abdul_Aziz_Shah_Bridge "wikilink").\[31\]

The final section being completed was the Teluk Intan–Sitiawan section.
Dubbed as the Sungai Perak–Lumut West Coastal Road Project, the final
section of the Federal Route 5 was constructed as a project under the
Fifth Malaysia Plan.\[32\] The project included the 1.3-km [Sultan Yusuf
Bridge](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Yusuf_Bridge "wikilink")
FT5, the longest bridge along the Federal Route 5. Before the bridge was
built, villagers from the opposite of the Perak River such as Telok
Selandang and Kampung Lekir had to use a river ferry service operated by
a nearby [油棕属](../Page/油棕属.md "wikilink") estate.\[33\] Construction of
the Sultan Yusuf Bridge began in April 1986 with the total cost of RM27
million for the entire road project.\[34\] The bridge was completed in
1988 and was opened to motorists on 17 November 1988, resulting the full
completion of the FT5 highway.\[35\]

The Federal Route 5 remains heavily used by travellers and commuters
along the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia and is unaffected by the
presence of the [南北大道](../Page/南北大道.md "wikilink") E1 and E2, as the FT5
highway is located far from the E1 and E2 expressways, besides the fact
that the FT5 highway passes through the most populated regions in
Peninsular Malaysia. As a result, many sections of the FT5 highway have
been upgraded either as [divided
highways](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/divided_highway "wikilink") or
super four highways.\[36\] For example, the Klang–Teluk Intan Road has
been upgraded to a super four highway, while the [Ipoh–Lumut
Highway](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipoh–Lumut_Highway "wikilink")
FT5, [Jalan
Langat](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klang–Banting_Highway "wikilink")
FT5 and [Pontian
Highway](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skudai–Pontian_Highway "wikilink")
are all being upgraded to divided highways, in order to handle the
increasing amount of traffic.

On 25 May 2015, the long-anticipated [West Coast
Expressway](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Expressway "wikilink")
E32 began its construction after numerous delays.\[37\] The 233-km
[高速公路](../Page/高速公路.md "wikilink") from [Changkat
Jering](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changkat_Jering "wikilink") to
[万津](../Page/万津.md "wikilink") was built as a coastal alternative to
the [南北大道](../Page/南北大道.md "wikilink") E1 and E2 that becomes congested
during holidays and festive seasons. However, the expressway
construction sparked yet another controversy, as the Tanjung
Karang–Hutan Melintang and Teluk Intan–Lekir sections will be using
the existing Federal Route 5, heavily violating the controlled-access
expressway standards defined in *Arahan Teknik 8/86: A Guide on
Geometric Design of Roads* by [Malaysian Public Works
Department](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Public_Works_Department "wikilink")
(JKR), hence the completed expressway may endanger the lives of local
villagers and expressway users as well.\[38\] As a result, the
[Malaysian Ministry of
Works](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Ministry_of_Works "wikilink")
is considering to re-evaluate the alignment of the expressway,
especially along the Tanjung Karang–Hutan Melintang section.\[39\]

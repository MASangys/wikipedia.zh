## History

### Ancient

[Bar'an_temple_1986-1.jpg](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bar'an_temple_1986-1.jpg "fig:Bar'an_temple_1986-1.jpg"),
a relic of the
[Sabaean](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabaean "wikilink") era\]\]

The Sabaean kingdom was based around Ma'rib, with territory in northern
Yemen. The Sabaean kings made their capital at Ma'rib, and built great
irrigation works such as the [Ma'rib
Dam](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma'rib_Dam "wikilink"), whose ruins
are still visible. The Marib Dam supported a flourishing culture for
more than a thousand years. They also built castles and temples in the
area, notably [Awwam](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awwam "wikilink")
and [Barran](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barran_Temple "wikilink"),
respectively. Saba was known for dealing in the lucrative
[frankincense](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankincense "wikilink")\[6\]
and [myrrh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/myrrh "wikilink")\[7\] trade.
They were a seafaring people and were known to have influence and a
population in the [Northeast
African](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Africa "wikilink")
kingdom of [Dʿmt](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dʿmt "wikilink"), across
the [Red Sea](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea "wikilink") in
[Eritrea](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea "wikilink") and
[Abyssinia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia "wikilink"), the only
other source of both frankincense and myrrh.

In 25 BC, [Aelius
Gallus](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aelius_Gallus "wikilink") of
[Rome](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "wikilink") led [an
expedition](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romans_in_Arabia#Aelius_Gallus_expedition "wikilink")
to Ma'rib, laying siege to the city. He suffered major losses and was
forced to retreat to
[Egypt](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_\(Roman_province\) "wikilink").\[8\]

The site of ancient Ma'rib was largely abandoned during the [20th
century](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century "wikilink").
Although a small
[village](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/village "wikilink") remains, the
multi-story
[mud-brick](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/mud-brick "wikilink")
buildings of the historic city are largely in
[ruins](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruins "wikilink"). The
[modern](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_history "wikilink")
[city](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/city "wikilink") of Ma'rib is
located about  north of the center of the ancient city.

### 20th century

In 1982, [floods](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/flood "wikilink")
ravaged the country. In response,
[Sheikh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh "wikilink") [Zayed bin
Sultan Al
Nahyan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayed_bin_Sultan_Al_Nahyan "wikilink")
of the [United Arab
Emirates](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates "wikilink")
financed the construction of the [current dam of
Ma'rib](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marib_Dam#Current_dam "wikilink")
in 1984.\[9\]\[10\]\[11\] The Shaikh himself was reportedly descended
from people who migrated from the area of Ma'rib to what is now the
UAE.\[12\]

### Yemeni Civil War

During the [Yemeni Civil War
(2015–present)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_\(2015–present\) "wikilink"),
Ma'rib and the surrounding [Ma'rib
Governorate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma'rib_Governorate "wikilink")
came under attack by the
[Houthis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthis "wikilink"), a Zaidi
Shia movement rebelling against the government of [Abdrabbuh Mansour
Hadi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdrabbuh_Mansour_Hadi "wikilink").
The tribes of Ma'rib repelled the Houthis with help from the [Saudi
Arabian-led intervention in
Yemen](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen "wikilink").

According to the [Abu
Dhabi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi "wikilink")-based *[The
National](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_\(Abu_Dhabi\) "wikilink")*
newspaper, "With 80 per cent of the province's population Sunni and only
one of the five main tribes supportive of the Zaidi Shiite Houthis,
tribal fighters managed to repel the attack. As a result, the Houthis
control only about 20 per cent of Marib and the oil fields remained
under Hadi's control. Many of the tribes in Marib, and in neighbouring
Al Jawf and Shabwa provinces, are loyal to Saudi Arabia, which has
offered financial support over many years. According to two tribal
chiefs there are 8,000 Yemeni forces and tribal fighters based in Marib
united against the Houthis. Some are directly loyal to President Hadi,
others to Saudi Arabia and a large number to the Islah Party, a
religiously conservative political group. The entire First Armoured
Brigade, considered a military wing of Islah, based in Sanaa, was
transferred to Marib in 2014 to defend the province. Other sections of
Yemen's military remained loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former
president overthrown by Arab Spring protests who has now sided with the
Houthis against Hadi. After the Saudi-led coalition joined the war in
March 2015 and drove the Houthis from most of Yemen's southern provinces
in July 2015, focus shifted to Marib, known s the gateway to Sana'a,
where the strong support base made it a natural location for an attack
in the north.

The city of Marib is just  from the capital, and the province adjoins
the predominantly Sunni provinces of Al Jawf, Al-Baitha and Shabwa,
where the Houthis' control is unlikely to hold if attacked. In
particular, Al-Jawf to the north would provide a route towards the
Houthi's Saada stronghold. The coalition began moving supplies to Marib
in March 2015, using land routes from Saudi Arabia through Hadramout and
Shabwa provinces. On August 2015, coalition forces started flying more
reinforcements to Marib using a small airport in the tiny town of Safer,
60km east of Marib city. Loyalist military sources said further
reinforcements including tanks, armoured vehicles, rocket launchers and
Apache helicopters arrived August 2015. The town serves as a base for
the state-run [Safer Exploration and Production Operations
Company](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen_Oil_and_Gas_Corporation "wikilink")
and other foreign companies working in Yemen's vital energy sector. The
main gas pipeline south also runs through the town, which is controlled
by the pro-Hadi military commander Abdullah Al-Shaddadi. The nearest
Houthi presence was in Baihan in Shabwa province,  away."\[13\]\[14\]

Forty-five [Emirati](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiratis "wikilink")
troops, along with 10
[Saudis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudis "wikilink") and 5
[Bahrainis](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain "wikilink") were
killed in a Houthi ballistic missile strike on the Safer base near
Ma'rib on December 14, 2015.\[15\]

According to
[Al-Jazeera](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jazeera "wikilink"), by 7
April 2015, Houthi forces had been expelled from the majority of [Ma'rib
Governorate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma'rib_Governorate "wikilink")
by Saudi-backed tribesmen. The governor of Marib told Al-Jazeera that
forces allied to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Gulf coalition
were "perusing the last pockets of Houthis" in the province.\[16\]

Five foreign [mine
clearance](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/mine_clearance "wikilink")
experts were killed in an explosion inside the [Saudi Project for
Landmine Clearance
MASAM](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Project_for_Landmine_Clearance_MASAM "wikilink")
on January 20 2019. One of the experts was a resident of [South
Africa](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "wikilink") of
[British](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people "wikilink")
descent. Other members of the team were from
[Colombia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia "wikilink") and
unspecified countries in
[Africa](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "wikilink").\[17\]

## Oil refinery

The [Yemen Oil Refining
Company](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen_Oil_and_Gas_Corporation "wikilink")
opened a
[refinery](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/oil_refinery "wikilink") in
Ma'rib in 1986, which produces  of oil per day (2009). In November 2009,
the company announced an agreement with
[Korea](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea "wikilink")'s Shinhan to
expand and upgrade the refinery to produce /day.\[18\]

Ma'rib is the start of the [Marib-Ra's Isa oil
pipeline](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marib-Ra's_Isa_oil_pipeline "wikilink")
(), with a capacity of  per day.\[19\]

## Climate

Ma'rib has a [hot desert
climate](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/hot_desert_climate "wikilink")
([Köppen climate
classification](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Köppen_climate_classification "wikilink"):

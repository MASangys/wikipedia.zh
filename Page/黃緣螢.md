**黃緣螢**（學名：**）是[螢科的一個物種](../Page/螢科.md "wikilink")，因在兩片[翅鞘間有淡黃色邊紋](../Page/翅鞘.md "wikilink")，故名為黃緣螢。本物種棲息於靜止的水域，其幼蟲亦是水生。

## 習性

儘管黃緣螢的幼蟲亦是水生，但牠們並不會游泳，而是只能夠在水底下爬行。 They go through six
[instars](../Page/instar.md "wikilink"). They eat small invertebrates
and carrion. The larvae probably burrow in mud during dry periods. The
adult's [light](../Page/bioluminescence.md "wikilink") is green-yellow.
The males fly to look for mates while the females usually do not fly,
remaining on the ground. About 100 eggs are laid on moist soil or
plants。In one experiment, the life cycle was completed in about 120
days。 A 2010 study recorded about 390 days, the larval stage spanning
about 330 days.
